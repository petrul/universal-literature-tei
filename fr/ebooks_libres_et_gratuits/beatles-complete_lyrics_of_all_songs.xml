                  <l>I read the news today, oh boy</l>
                  <l>About a lucky man who made the grade.</l>
                  <l>And though the news was rather sad,</l>
                  <l>I just had to laugh,</l>
                  <l>I saw the photograph.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>He blew his mind out in a car.</l>
                  <l>He didn't notice that the lights had changed.</l>
                  <l>A crowd a people stood and stared,</l>
                  <l>They'd seen his face before.</l>
                  <l>Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>I saw a film today, oh boy.</l>
                  <l>The English army had just won the war.</l>
                  <l>A crowd of people turned away,</l>
                  <l>But I just had to look.</l>
                  <l>Having read the book,</l>
                  <l>I'd love to turn you on.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Woke up fell out of bed</l>
                  <l>Dragged a comb across my head.</l>
                  <l>Found my way down stairs and drunk a cup</l>
                  <l>And looking up I notice I was late.</l>
                  <l>Found my coat and grabbed my hat,</l>
                  <l>Made the bus is second flat.</l>
                  <l>Found my way up stairs and hot a smoke</l>
                  <l>And somebody spoke and I went into a dream.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>I heard the news today, oh boy.</l>
                  <l>Four thousand holes in Blackburn Lancashire.</l>
                  <l>And though the holes were rather small,</l>
                  <l>They had to count them all.</l>
                  <l>Now they know haw many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall.</l>
                  <l>I'd love to turn you on.</l>

                  <l>Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs</l>
                  <l>Of ev'ry head he's had the pleasure to know.</l>
                  <l>And all the people that come and go stop and say hello.</l>
                  <l>Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.</l>
                  <l>Wet behind the blue suburban skies</l>
                  <l>I sit and meanwhile back</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>On the corner is a banker with a motor car.</l>
                  <l>The little children laugh at him behind his back.</l>
                  <l>And the banker never wears a "mac" in the pouring rain, very strange.</l>
                  <l>Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.</l>
                  <l>Wet behind the blue suburban skies</l>
                  <l>I sit and meanwhile back</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hour glass.</l>
                  <l>And in his pocket is a portrait of the queen.</l>
                  <l>He likes to keep his fire engine clean, it's a clean machine.</l>
                  <l>Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.</l>
                  <l>Full of fish and finger pies</l>
                  <l>In summer meanwhile back</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>In Penny Lane the barber shawes another customer.</l>
                  <l>We see the baner sitting, waiting for a trend.</l>
                  <l>And then the fireman rushes in from the pouring rain, very strange</l>
                  <l>Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.</l>
                  <l>Wet behind the blue suburban skies</l>
                  <l>I sit and meanwhile back</l>
                  <l>Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes.</l>
                  <l>Wet behind the blue suburban skies,</l>

                  <l>Rocky Raccoon checked into his room only to find Gideon's Bible.</l>
                  <l>Rocky had come equipped with a gun to shoot off the legs of his rival.</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>His rival it seems had broken his dreams by stealing the girl of his fancy.</l>
                  <l>Her name was Magill, she called herself Lil, but ev'ryone knew her as Nancy.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Now she and her man who called himself Dan were in the next room as the show down.</l>
                  <l>Rocky burst in and grinning a grin he said, " Danny boy, this is a show down."</l>
                  <l>But Daniel was hot, he drew first and shot and Rocky collapsed in the garden.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Now the doctor came in stinking of gin and proceeded to lie on the table.</l>
                  <l>He said, "Rocky......."</l>
                  <l>And Rocky said, "Doc, it's only a scratch, and I'll be better,</l>
                  <l>I' be better, Doc, as soon as I'm able."</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Now Rocky Raccoon, he fell back his room only to find Gideon's Bible.</l>

                  <l>Gideon checked out and he left it no doubt to help with good Rocky's read Bible.</l>

                  <l>Birds sing out of tune and rain drops hide the moon. I'm O.K.</l>
                  <l>Here I'll say with my loneliness.</l>
                  <l/>
                  <l>I don't care what they say,</l>
                  <l>I won't stay in a word without love.</l>
                  <l/>
                  <l>So I wait and in a smile I will see my true love smile.</l>
                  <l>She may come, I know not when, when she does I'll know,</l>
                  <l>So baby until then, lock me away and don't allow the day here inside</l>
                  <l>Where I hide with my loneliness.</l>
                  <l/>
                  <l>I don't care what they say,</l>
                  <l>I won't stay in a word without love.</l>

                  <l>In the town where I was born</l>
                  <l>Lived a man who sailed to sea,</l>
