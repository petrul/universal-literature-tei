                  <head>Introduction</head>
                  <p rend="justify">One day in the autumn of 1888, in the island of Tahiti, during an illness which he supposed might be his last, Stevenson put into the hands of his stepson, Mr. Lloyd Osbourne, a sealed paper with the request that it should be opened after his death.  He recovered, as every one knows, and had strength enough to enjoy six years more of active life and work in the Pacific Islands.  When the end came, and the paper was opened, it was found to contain, among other things, the expression of his wish that I should be asked to prepare for publication ‘a selection of his letters and a sketch of his life.’  The journal letters written to myself from his Samoan home, subsequently to the date of the request, offered the readiest material towards fulfilling promptly a part at least of the duty thus laid upon me; and a selection from these was accordingly published in the autumn following his death. <ref target="#1730040348670317495_622-h-3.htm.xhtml#footnotexv">[xv]</ref>
                  </p>
                  <p rend="justify">The scanty leisure of an official life (chiefly employed as it was for several years in seeing my friend’s collected and posthumous works through the press) did not allow me to complete the remainder of my task without considerable delay.  For one thing, the body of correspondence which came in from various quarters turned out much larger than had been anticipated, and the labour of sifting and arranging it much greater.  The author of <hi rend="italic">Treasure Island</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Across the Plains</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Weir of Hermiston</hi> did not love writing letters, and will be found somewhere in the following pages referring to himself as one ‘essentially and originally incapable of the art epistolary.’  That he was a bad correspondent had even come to be an accepted view among his friends; but in truth it was only during one particular period of his life (see below, vol. i. p. 103) that he at all deserved such a reproach.  At other times, as is now apparent, he had shown a degree of industry and spirit in letter-writing extraordinary considering his health and occupations, and especially considering his declared aversion for the task.  His letters, it is true, were often the most informal in the world, and he generally neglected to date them, a habit which is the despair of editors; but after his own whim and fashion he wrote a vast number; so that for every one here included some half-a-dozen at least have had to be rejected.</p>
                  <p rend="justify">In considering the scale and plan on which my friend’s instruction should be carried out, it seemed necessary to take into account, not his own always modest opinion of himself, but the place which, as time went on, he seemed likely to take ultimately in the world’s regard.  The four or five years following the death of a writer much applauded in his lifetime are generally the years when the decline of his reputation begins, if it is going to suffer decline at all.  At present, certainly, Stevenson’s name seems in no danger of going down.  On the stream of daily literary reference and allusion it floats more actively than ever.  In another sense its vitality is confirmed by the material test of continued sales and of the market.  Since we have lost him other writers, whose beginnings he watched with sympathetic interest, have come to fill a greater immediate place in public attention; one especially has struck notes which appeal to dominant fibres in our Anglo-Saxon stock with irresistible force; but none has exercised Stevenson’s peculiar and personal power to charm, to attach, and to inspirit.  By his study of perfection in form and style—qualities for which his countrymen in general have been apt to care little—he might seem destined to give pleasure chiefly to the fastidious and the artistically minded.  But as to its matter, the main appeal of his work is not to any mental tastes and fashions of the few; it is rather to universal, hereditary instincts, to the primitive sources of imaginative excitement and entertainment in the race.</p>
                  <p rend="justify">By virtue, then, of this double appeal of form and matter; by his especial hold upon the young, in whose spirit so much of his best work was done; by his undecaying influence on other writers; by the spell which he still exercises from the grave, and exercises most strongly on those who are most familiar with the best company whether of the living or the dead, Stevenson’s name and memory, so far as can be judged at present, seem destined not to dwindle, but to grow.  The voice of the <hi rend="italic">advocatus diaboli</hi> has been heard against him, as it is right and proper that it should be heard against any man before his reputation can be held fully established.  One such advocate in this country has thought to dispose of him by the charge of ‘externality.’  But the reader who remembers things like the sea-frenzy of Gordon Darnaway, or the dialogue of Markheim with his other self in the house of murder, or the re-baptism of the spirit of Seraphina in the forest dews, or the failure of Herrick to find in the waters of the island lagoon a last release from dishonour, or the death of Goguelat, or the appeal of Kirstie Elliot in the midnight chamber—such a reader can only smile at a criticism like this and put it by.  These and a score of other passages breathe the essential poetry and significance of things as they reveal themselves to true masters only—are instinct at once with the morality and the romance which lie deep together at the soul of nature and experience.  Not in vain had Stevenson read the lesson of the Lantern-Bearers, and hearkened to the music of the pipes of Pan.  He was feeling his way all his life towards a fuller mastery of his means, preferring always to leave unexpressed what he felt that he could not express perfectly; and in much of his work was content merely to amuse himself and others.  But even when he is playing most fancifully with his art and his readers, as in the shudders, tempered with laughter, of the Suicide Club, or the airy sentimental comedy of Providence and the Guitar, or the schoolboy historical inventions of Dickon Crookback and the old sailor Arblaster, a writer of his quality cannot help striking notes from the heart of life and the inwardness of things deeper than will ever be struck, or even apprehended, by another who labours, with never a smile either of his own or of his reader’s, upon the most solemn enterprises of realistic fiction, but is born without the magician’s touch and insight.</p>
                  <p rend="justify">Another advocate on the same side, in the United States, has made much of the supposed dependence of this author on his models, and classed him among writers whose inspiration is imitative and second-hand.  But this, surely, is to be quite misled by the well-known passage of Stevenson’s own, in which he speaks of himself as having in his prentice years played the ‘sedulous ape’ to many writers of different styles and periods.  In doing this he was not seeking inspiration, but simply practising the use of the tools which were to help him to express his own inspirations.  Truly he was always much of a reader; but it was life, not books, that always in the first degree allured and taught him.</p>
                  <p rend="justify">‘He loved of life the myriad sides,<lb/>Pain, prayer, or pleasure, act or sleep,<lb/>As wallowing narwhals love the deep’—</p>
                  <p rend="justify">so with just self-knowledge he wrote of himself; and the books which he most cared for and lived with were those of which the writers seemed—to quote again a phrase of his own—to have been ‘eavesdropping at the door of his heart’; those which told of moods, impressions, experiences or cravings after experience, pains, pleasures, opinions or conflicts of the spirit, which in the eagerness of youthful living and thinking had already been his own.  No man, in fact, was ever less inclined to take anything at second-hand.  The root of all originality was in him, in the shape of an extreme natural vividness of perception, imagination, and feeling.  An instinctive and inbred unwillingness to accept the accepted and conform to the conventional was of the essence of his character, whether in life or art, and was a source to him both of strength and weakness.  He would not follow a general rule—least of all if it was a prudential rule—of conduct unless he was clear that it was right according to his private conscience; nor would he join, in youth, in the ordinary social amusements of his class when he had once found out that they did not amuse <hi rend="italic">him</hi>; nor wear their clothes if he could not feel at ease and be himself in them; nor use, whether in speech or writing, any trite or inanimate form of words that did not faithfully and livingly express his thought.  A readier acceptance of current usages might have been better for him, but was simply not in his nature.  ‘Damp gingerbread puppets’ were to him the persons who lived and thought and felt and acted only as was expected of them.  ‘To see people skipping all round us with their eyes sealed up with indifference, knowing nothing of the earth or man or woman, going automatically to offices and saying they are happy or unhappy, out of a sense of duty I suppose, surely at least from no sense of happiness or unhappiness, unless perhaps they have a tooth that twinges—is it not like a bad dream?’  No reader of this book will close it, I am sure, without feeling that he has been throughout in the company of a spirit various indeed and many-mooded, but profoundly sincere and real.  Ways that in another might easily have been mere signs of affectation were in him the true expression of a nature ten times more spontaneously itself and individually alive than that of others.  Self-consciousness, in many characters that possess it, deflects and falsifies conduct; and so does the dramatic instinct.  Stevenson was self-conscious in a high degree, but only as a part of his general activity of mind; only in so far as he could not help being an extremely intelligent spectator of his own doings and feelings; these themselves came from springs of character and impulse much too deep and strong to be diverted.  He loved also, with a child’s or actor’s gusto, to play a part and make a drama out of life; <ref target="#1730040348670317495_622-h-3.htm.xhtml#footnotexxi">[xxi]</ref> but the part was always for the moment his very own: he had it not in him to pose for anything but what he truly was.</p>
                  <p rend="justify">When a man so constituted had once mastered his craft of letters, he might take up whatever instrument he pleased with the instinctive and just confidence that he would play upon it to a tune and with a manner of his own.  This is indeed the true mark and test of his originality.  He has no need to be, or to seem, especially original in the form and mode of literature which he attempts.  By his choice of these he may at any time give himself and his reader the pleasure of recalling, like a familiar air, some strain of literary association; but in so doing he only adds a secondary charm to his work; the vision, the temperament, the mode of conceiving and handling, are in every case strongly personal to himself.  He may try his hand in youth at a Sentimental Journey, but R. L. S. cannot choose but be at the opposite pole of human character and feeling from Laurence Sterne.  In tales of mystery, allegorical or other, he may bear in mind the precedent of Edgar Poe, and yet there is nothing in style and temper much wider apart than <hi rend="italic">Markheim</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Jekyll and Hyde</hi> are from the <hi rend="italic">Murders in the Rue Morgue</hi> or <hi rend="italic">William Wilson</hi>.  He may set out to tell a pirate story for boys ‘exactly in the ancient way,’ and it will come from him not in the ancient way at all, but re-minted; marked with a sharpness and saliency in the characters, a private stamp of buccaneering ferocity combined with smiling humour, an energy of vision and happy vividness of presentment, which are shiningly his own.  Another time, he may desert the paths of Kingston and Ballantyne the brave for those of Sir Walter Scott; but literature presents few stronger contrasts than between any scene of <hi rend="italic">Waverley</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Redgauntlet</hi> and any scene of the <hi rend="italic">Master of Ballantrae</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Catriona</hi>, whether in their strength or weakness: and it is the most loyal lovers of the older master who take the greatest pleasure in reading the work of the younger, so much less opulently gifted as is probable—though we must remember that Stevenson died at the age when Scott wrote <hi rend="italic">Waverley</hi>—so infinitely more careful of his gift.  Stevenson may even blow upon the pipe of Burns, and yet his tune will be no echo, but one which utters the heart and mind of a Scots poet who has his own outlook on life, his own special and profitable vein of smiling or satirical contemplation.</p>
                  <p rend="justify">Not by reason, then, of ‘externality,’ for sure, nor yet of imitativeness, will this writer lose his hold on the attention and regard of his countrymen.  The debate, before his place in literature is settled, must rather turn on other points: as whether the genial essayist and egoist or the romantic inventor and narrator was the stronger in him—whether the Montaigne and Pepys elements prevailed in his literary composition or the Scott and Dumas elements—a question indeed which among those who care for him most has always been at issue.  Or again, what degree of true inspiring and illuminating power belongs to the gospel, or gospels, airily encouraging or gravely didactic, which are set forth in the essays with so captivating a grace?  Or whether in romance and tale he had a power of happily inventing and soundly constructing a whole fable comparable to his unquestionable power of conceiving and presenting single scenes and situations in a manner which stamps them indelibly on the reader’s mind.  And whether his figures are sustained continuously by the true, large, spontaneous breath of creation, or are but transitorily animated at critical and happy moments by flashes of spiritual and dramatic insight, aided by the conscious devices of his singularly adroit and spirited art?  This is a question which no criticism but that of time can solve; it takes the consenting instinct of generations to feel whether the creatures of fiction, however powerfully they may strike at first, are durably and equably, or ephemerally and fitfully, alive.  To contend, as some do, that strong creative impulse, and so keen an artistic self-consciousness as Stevenson’s was, cannot exist together, is quite idle.  The truth, of course, is that the deep-seated energies of imaginative creation are found sometimes in combination, and sometimes not in combination, with an artistic intelligence thus keenly conscious of its own purpose and watchful of its own working.</p>
                  <p rend="justify">Once more, it may be questioned whether, among the many varieties of work which Stevenson has left, all touched with genius, all charming and stimulating to the literary sense, all distinguished by a grace and precision of workmanship which are the rarest qualities in English art, there are any which can be pointed to as absolute masterpieces, such as the future cannot be expected to let die.  Let the future decide.  What is certain is that posterity must either be very well, or very ill, occupied if it can consent to give up so much sound entertainment, and better than entertainment, as this writer afforded his contemporaries.  In the meantime, among judicious readers on both sides of the Atlantic, Stevenson stands, I think it may safely be said, as a true master of English prose; unsurpassed for the union of lenity and lucidity with suggestive pregnancy and poetic animation; for harmony of cadence and the well-knit structure of sentences; and for the art of imparting to words the vital quality of things, and making them convey the precise—sometimes, let it be granted, the too curiously precise—expression of the very shade and colour of the thought, feeling, or vision in his mind.  He stands, moreover, as the writer who, in the last quarter of the nineteenth century, has handled with the most of freshness and inspiriting power the widest range of established literary forms—the moral, critical, and personal essay, travels sentimental and other, romances and short tales both historical and modern, parables and tales of mystery, boys’ stories of adventure, memoirs—nor let lyrical and meditative verse both English and Scottish, and especially nursery verse, a new vein for genius to work in, be forgotten.  To some of these forms Stevenson gave quite new life; through all alike he expressed vividly an extremely personal way of seeing and being, a sense of nature and romance, of the aspects of human existence and problems of human conduct, which was essentially his own.  And in so doing he contrived to make friends and even lovers of his readers.  Those whom he attracts at all (and there is no writer who attracts every one) are drawn to him over and over again, finding familiarity not lessen but increase the charm of his work, and desiring ever closer intimacy with the spirit and personality which they divine behind it.</p>
                  <p rend="justify">As to the fitting scale, then, on which to treat the memory of a man who fills five years after his death such a place as this in the public regard, the words ‘selection’ and ‘sketch’ have evidently to be given a pretty liberal interpretation.  Readers, it must be supposed, will scarce be content without both a fairly full biography, and the opportunity of a fairly ample intercourse with the man as he was accustomed to reveal himself in writing to his familiars.  As to form—Stevenson’s own words and the nature of the material alike seem to indicate that the <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi> should be kept separate.  There are some kinds of correspondence which can conveniently be woven into the body and texture of a biography, though indeed I think it is a plan to which biographers are much too partial.  Nothing, surely, more checks the flow of a narrative than its interruption by stationary blocks of correspondence; nothing more disconcerts the reader than a too frequent or too abrupt alternation of voices between the subject of a biography speaking in his letters and the writer of it speaking in his narrative.  At least it is only when letters are occupied, as Macaulay’s for instance were, almost entirely with facts and events, that they can without difficulty be handled in this way.  But events and facts, ‘sordid facts,’ as he called them, were not very often suffered to intrude into Stevenson’s correspondence.  ‘I deny,’ he writes, ‘that letters should contain news (I mean mine; those of other people should).  But mine should contain appropriate sentiments and humorous nonsense, or nonsense without the humour.’  Business letters, letters of information, and letters of courtesy he had sometimes to write: but when he wrote best was under the influence of the affection or impression, or the mere whim or mood, of the moment; pouring himself out in all manner of rhapsodical confessions and speculations, grave or gay, notes of observation and criticism, snatches of remembrance and autobiography, moralisings on matters uppermost for the hour in his mind, comments on his own work or other people’s, or mere idle fun and foolery.</p>
                  <p rend="justify">With a letter-writer of this character, as it seems to me, a judicious reader desires to be left as much alone as possible.  What he wants is to relish the correspondence by itself, or with only just so much in the way of notes and introductions as may serve to make allusions and situations clear.  Two volumes, then, of letters so edited, to be preceded by a separate introductory volume of narrative and critical memoir, or <hi rend="italic">étude</hi>—such was to be the memorial to my friend which I had planned, and hoped by this time to have ready.  Unfortunately, the needful leisure has hitherto failed me, and might fail me for some time yet, to complete the separate volume of biography.  That is now, at the wish of the family, to be undertaken by Stevenson’s cousin and my friend, Mr. Graham Balfour.  Meanwhile the <hi rend="italic">Letters</hi>, with introductions and notes somewhat extended from the original plan, are herewith presented as a substantive work by themselves.</p>
                  <p rend="justify">The book will enable those who know and love their Stevenson already to know him more intimately, and, as I hope, to love him more.  It contains, certainly, much that is most essentially characteristic of the man.  To some, perhaps, that very lack of art as a correspondent of which we have found him above accusing himself may give the reading an added charm and flavour.  What he could do as an artist we know—what a telling power and heightened thrill he could give to all his effects, in so many different modes of expression and composition, by calculated skill and the deliberate exercise of a perfectly trained faculty.  This is the quality which nobody denies him, and which so deeply impressed his fellow-craftsmen of all kinds.  I remember the late Sir John Millais, a shrewd and very independent judge of books, calling across to me at a dinner-table, ‘You know Stevenson, don’t you?’ and then going on, ‘Well, I wish you would tell him from me, if he cares to know, that to my mind he is the very first of living artists.  I don’t mean writers merely, but painters and all of us: nobody living can see with such an eye as that fellow, and nobody is such a master of his tools.’  Now in his letters, excepting a few written in youth, and having more or less the character of exercises, and a few in after years which were intended for the public eye, Stevenson the deliberate artist is scarcely forthcoming at all.  He does not care a fig for order or logical sequence or congruity, or for striking a key of expression and keeping it, but becomes simply the most spontaneous and unstudied of human beings.  He will write with the most distinguished elegance on one day, with simple good sense and good feeling on a second, with flat triviality on another, and with the most slashing, often ultra-colloquial, vehemence on a fourth, or will vary through all these moods and more in one and the same letter.  He has at his command the whole vocabularies of the English and Scottish languages, classical and slang, with good stores of the French, and tosses and tumbles them about irresponsibly to convey the impression or affection, the mood or freak of the moment.  Passages or phrases of the craziest schoolboy or seafaring slang come tumbling after and capping others of classical cadence and purity, of poetical and heartfelt eloquence.  By this medley of moods and manners, Stevenson’s letters at their best—the pick, let us say, of those in the following volumes which were written from Hyères or Bournemouth—come nearer than anything else to the full-blooded charm and variety of his conversation.</p>
                  <p rend="justify">Nearer, yet not quite near; for it was in company only that this genial spirit rose to his very best.  Those whom his writings charm or impress, but who never knew him, can but imagine how doubly they would have been charmed and impressed by his presence.  Few men probably, certainly none that I have ever seen or read of, have had about them such a richness and variety of human nature; and few can ever have been better gifted than he was to express the play of being that was in him by means of the apt, expressive word and the animated look and gesture.  <hi rend="italic">Divers et ondoyant</hi>, in the words of Montaigne, beyond other men, he seemed to contain within himself a whole troop of singularly assorted characters—the poet and artist, the moralist and preacher, the humourist and jester, the man of great heart and tender conscience, the man of eager appetite and curiosity, the Bohemian, impatient of restraints and shams, the adventurer and lover of travel and of action: characters, several of them, not rare separately, especially among his Scottish fellow-countrymen, but rare indeed to be found united, and each in such fulness and intensity, within the bounds of a single personality.</p>
                  <p rend="justify">Before all things Stevenson was a born poet, to whom the world was full of enchantment and of latent romance, only waiting to take shape and substance in the forms art.  It was his birthright—</p>
                  <p rend="justify">            ‘to hear<lb/>The great bell beating far and near—<lb/>The odd, unknown, enchanted gong<lb/>That on the road hales men along,<lb/>That from the mountain calls afar,<lb/>That lures the vessel from a star,<lb/>And with a still, aerial sound<lb/>Makes all the earth enchanted ground.’</p>
                  <p rend="justify">At the same time, he was not less a born preacher and moralist after his fashion.  A true son of the Covenanters, he had about him little spirit of social or other conformity; but an active and searching private conscience kept him for ever calling in question both the grounds of his own conduct and the validity of the accepted codes and compromises of society.  He must try to work out a scheme of morality suitable to his own case and temperament, which found the prohibitory law of Moses chill and uninspiring, but in the Sermon on the Mount a strong incentive to all those impulses of pity and charity to which his heart was prone.  In youth his sense of social injustice and the inequalities of human opportunity made him inwardly much of a rebel, who would have embraced and acted on theories of socialism or communism, could he have found any that did not seem to him at variance with ineradicable instincts of human nature. <ref target="#1730040348670317495_622-h-3.htm.xhtml#footnotexxx">[xxx]</ref>  All his life the artist and the moralist in him alike were in rebellion against the bourgeois spirit,—against timid, negative, and shuffling substitutes for active and courageous well-doing,—and declined to worship at the shrine of what he called the bestial goddesses Comfort and Respectability.  The moralist in him helped the artist by backing with the force of a highly sensitive conscience his instinctive love of perfection in his work.  The poet and artist qualified the moralist by discountenancing any preference for the harsh, the sour, or the self-mortifying forms of virtue, and encouraging the love for all tender or heroic, glowing, generous and cheerful forms.</p>
                  <p rend="justify">In another aspect of his many-sided being Stevenson was not less a born adventurer and practical experimentalist in life.  Many poets are content to dream, and many, perhaps most, moralists to preach; but Stevenson must ever be doing and undergoing.  He was no sentimentalist, to pay himself with fine feelings whether for mean action or slack inaction.  He had an insatiable zest for all experiences, not the pleasurable only, but including even the more harsh and biting—those that bring home to a man the pinch and sting of existence as it is realised by the disinherited of the world, and excluding only what he thought the prim, the conventional, the dead-alive, and the cut-and-dry.  On occasion the experimentalist and man of adventure in him would enter into special partnership with the moralist and man of conscience; he loved to find himself in difficult social passes and ethical dilemmas for the sake of trying to behave in them to the utmost according to his own personal sense of the obligations of honour, duty, and kindness.  In yet another part of his being, he cherished, as his great countryman Scott had done before him, an intense underlying longing for the life of action, danger, and command.  ‘Action, Colvin, action,’ I remember his crying eagerly to me with his hand on my arm as we lay basking for his health’s sake in a boat off the scented shores of the Cap St. Martin.  Another time—this was on his way to a winter cure at Davos—some friend had given him General Hamley’s <hi rend="italic">Operations of War</hi>:—‘in which,’ he writes to his father, ‘I am drowned a thousand fathoms deep, and O that I had been a soldier is still my cry.’  In so frail a tabernacle was it that the aspirations of the artist, the unconventional moralist, the lover of all experience, and the lover of daring action had to learn to reconcile themselves as best they might.  Frail as it was, it contained withal a strong animal nature, and he was as much exposed to the storms and solicitations of sense as to the cravings and questionings of the spirit.  Fortunately, with all these ardent and divers instincts, there were present two invaluable gifts besides—that of humour, which for all his stress of being and vivid consciousness of self saved him from ever seeing himself for long together out of a just proportion, and kept wholesome laughter always ready at his lips; and that of a perfectly warm, loyal, and tender heart, which through all his experiments and agitations made the law of kindness the one ruling law of his life.  In the end, lack of health determined his career, giving the chief part in his life to the artist and man of imagination, and keeping the man of action a prisoner in the sickroom until, by a singular turn of destiny, he was able to wring a real, prolonged, and romantically successful adventure out of that voyage to the Pacific which had been, in its origin, the last despairing resource of the invalid.</p>
                  <p rend="justify">To take this multiple personality from another point of view, it was part of his genius that he never seemed to be cramped like the rest of us, at any given time of life, within the limits of his proper age, but to be child, boy, young man, and old man all at once.  There was never a time in his life when Stevenson had to say with St. Augustine, ‘Behold! my childhood is dead, but I am alive.’  The child, as his <hi rend="italic">Garden of Verses</hi> vividly attests, and as will be seen by abundant evidence in the course of the following pages, lived on always in him, not in memory only, but in real survival, with all its freshness of perception unimpaired, and none of its play instincts in the least degree extinguished or made ashamed.  As for the perennial boy in Stevenson, that is too apparent to need remark.  It was as a boy for boys that he wrote the best known of his books, <hi rend="italic">Treasure Island</hi>; with all boys that he met, provided they were really boys and not prigs nor puppies, he was instantly at home; and the ideal of a career which he most inwardly and longingly cherished, the ideals of practical adventure and romance, of desirable predicaments and gratifying modes of escape from them, were from first to last those of a boy.  At the same time, even when I first knew him, there were about him occasional traits and glimpses of old sagacity, of premature life-wisdom and experience, such as find expression, for instance, in the essay <hi rend="italic">Virginibus Puerisque</hi>, among other matter more according with his then age of twenty-six.</p>
                  <p rend="justify">Again, it is said that in every poet there must be something of the woman—the receptivity, the emotional nature.  If to be impressionable in the extreme, quick in sympathy and feeling, ardent in attachment, and full of pity for the weak and suffering, is to be womanly, Stevenson was certainly all those; he was even like a woman in being <hi rend="italic">ἀρτίδακρυς</hi>, easily moved to tears at the touch of pity or affection, or even at any specially poignant impression of art or beauty.  But yet, if any one word were to be chosen for the predominant quality of his character and example, I suppose that word would be manly.  In all his habits and instincts he was the least effeminate of men; and effeminacy, or aught approaching sexlessness, was perhaps the only quality in man with which he had no patience.  In his gentle and complying nature there were strains of iron tenacity and will.  He had both kinds of physical courage—the active, delighting in danger, and the passive, unshaken in endurance.  In the moral courage of facing situations and consequences, of cheerful self-discipline and readiness to pay for faults committed, of outspokenness, admitting no ambiguous relations and clearing away the clouds from human intercourse, I have not known his equal.  His great countryman Scott, as this book will prove, was not more manfully free from artistic jealousy or the least shade of irritability under criticism, or more modestly and unfeignedly inclined to exaggerate the qualities of other people’s work and to underrate those of his own.  His severest critic was always himself; the next most severe, those of his own household and intimacy, whose love made them jealous lest he should fall short of his best; for he lived in an atmosphere of love, indeed, but not of flattery.  Of the humorous and engaging parts of vanity and egoism, which led him to make infinite talk and fun about himself, and use his own experiences as a key for unlocking the confidences of others, Stevenson had plenty; but of the morose and fretful parts never a shade.  ‘A little Irish girl,’ he wrote once during a painful crisis of his life, ‘is now reading my book aloud to her sister at my elbow; they chuckle, and I feel flattered.—Yours, R. L. S.  <hi rend="italic">P.S.</hi> Now they yawn, and I am indifferent.  Such a wisely conceived thing is vanity.’  If only vanity so conceived were commoner!  And whatever might be the abstract and philosophical value of that somewhat grimly stoical conception of the universe, of conduct and duty, at which in mature years he had arrived, want of manliness is certainly not its fault.  Nor is any such want to be found in the practice which he founded on or combined with it; in his invincible gaiety and sweetness under sufferings and deprivations the most galling to him; in the temper which made his presence in health or sickness a perpetual sunshine to those about him.  Take the kind of maxims of life which he was accustomed to forge for himself and to act by:—‘Acts may be forgiven; not even God can forgive the hanger-back.’  ‘Choose the best, if you can; or choose the worst; that which hangs in the wind dangles from a gibbet.’  ‘“Shall I?” said Feeble-mind; and the echo said, “Fie!”’  ‘“Do I love?” said Loveless; and the echo laughed.’  ‘A fault known is a fault cured to the strong; but to the weak it is a fetter riveted.’  ‘The mean man doubts, the great-hearted is deceived.’  ‘Great-heart was deceived.  “Very well,” said Great-heart.’  ‘“I have not forgotten my umbrella,” said the careful man; but the lightning struck him.’  ‘Nullity wanted nothing; so he supposed he wanted advice.’  ‘Evil was called Youth till he was old, and then he was called Habit.’  ‘Fear kept the house; and still he must pay taxes.’  ‘Shame had a fine bed, but where was slumber?  Once he was in jail he slept.’  With this moralist maxims meant actions; and where shall we easily find a much manlier spirit of wisdom than this?</p>
                  <p rend="justify">There was yet another and very different side to Stevenson which struck others more than it struck myself, namely, that of the perfectly freakish, not perfectly human, irresponsible madcap or jester which sometimes appeared in him.  It is true that his demoniac quickness of wit and intelligence suggested occasionally a ‘spirit of air and fire’ rather than one of earth; that he was abundantly given to all kinds of quirk and laughter; and that there was no jest (saving the unkind) he would not make and relish.  In the streets of Edinburgh he had certainly been known for queer pranks and mystifications in youth; and up to middle life there seemed to some of his friends to be much, if not of the Puck, at least of the Ariel, about him.  The late Mr. J. A. Symonds always called him Sprite; qualifying the name, however, by the epithets ‘most fantastic, but most human.’  To me the essential humanity was always the thing most apparent.  In a fire well nourished of seasoned ship-timber, the flames glance fantastically and of many colours, but the glow at heart is ever deep and strong; it was at such a glow that the friends of Stevenson were accustomed to warm their hands, while they admired and were entertained by the shifting lights.</p>
                  <p rend="justify">It was only in talk, as I have said, that all the many lights and colours of this richly compounded spirit could be seen in full play.  He would begin no matter how—in early days often with a jest at his own absurd garments, or with the recitation, in his vibrating voice and full Scotch accent, of some snatch of poetry that was haunting him, or with a rhapsody of analytic delight over some minute accident of beauty or expressiveness that had struck his observation, and would have escaped that of everybody else, in man, woman, child, or external nature.  And forthwith the floodgates would be opened, and the talk would stream on in endless, never importunate, flood and variety.  A hundred fictitious characters would be invented, differentiated, and launched on their imaginary careers; a hundred ingenious problems of conduct and cases of honour would be set and solved, in a manner often quite opposed to conventional precept; romantic voyages would be planned and followed out in vision, with a thousand incidents, to all the corners of our own planet and of others; the possibilities of life and art would be illuminated with glancing search-lights of bewildering range and penetration, the most sober argument alternating with the maddest freaks of fancy, high poetic eloquence with coruscations of insanely apposite slang—the earthiest jape anon shooting up into the empyrean and changing into the most ethereal fantasy—the stalest and most vulgarised forms of speech gaining brilliancy and illuminating power from some hitherto undreamt-of application—and all the while an atmosphere of goodwill diffusing itself from the speaker, a glow of eager benignity and affectionate laughter emanating from his presence, till every one about him seemed to catch something of his own gift and inspiration.  This sympathetic power of inspiring others was the special and distinguishing note of Stevenson’s conversation.  He would keep a houseful or a single companion entertained all day, and day after day and half the nights, yet never seemed to dominate the talk or absorb it; rather he helped every one about him to discover and to exercise unexpected powers of their own.  The point could hardly be better brought out than it is in a fragment which I borrow from Mr. Henley of an unpublished character-sketch of his friend: ‘I leave his praise in this direction (the telling of Scottish vernacular stories) to others.  It is more to my purpose to note that he will discourse with you of morals, music, marbles, men, manners, metaphysics, medicine, mangold-wurzel—<hi rend="italic">que scays-je</hi>?—with equal insight into essentials and equal pregnancy and felicity of utterance; and that he will stop with you to make mud pies in the first gutter, range in your company whatever heights of thought and feeling you have found accessible, and end by guiding you to altitudes far nearer the stars than you have ever dreamed of footing it; and that at the last he makes you wonder which to admire the more—his easy familiarity with the Eternal Veracities or the brilliant flashes of imbecility with which his excursions into the Infinite are sometimes diversified.  He radiates talk, as the sun does light and heat; and after an evening—or a week—with him, you come forth with a sense of satisfaction in your own capacity which somehow proves superior even to the inevitable conclusion that your brilliance was but the reflection of his own, and that all the while you were only playing the part of Rubinstein’s piano or Sarasate’s violin.’</p>
                  <p rend="justify">All this the reader should imagine as helped by the most speaking of presences: a steady, penetrating fire in the wide-set eyes, a compelling power and sweetness in the smile; courteous, waving gestures of the arms and long, nervous hands, a lit cigarette generally held between the fingers; continual rapid shiftings and pacings to and fro as he conversed: rapid, but not flurried nor awkward, for there was a grace in his attenuated but well-carried figure, and his movements were light, deft, and full of spring.  When I first knew him he was passing through a period of neatness between two of Bohemian carelessness as to dress; so that the effect of his charm was immediate.  At other times of his youth there was something for strangers, and even for friends, to get over in the odd garments which it was his whim to wear—the badge, as they always seemed to me, partly of a genuine carelessness, certainly of a genuine lack of cash (the little he had was always absolutely at the disposal of his friends), partly of a deliberate detachment from any particular social class or caste, partly of his love of pickles and adventures, which he thought befel a man thus attired more readily than another.  But this slender, slovenly, nondescript apparition, long-visaged and long-haired, had only to speak in order to be recognised in the first minute for a witty and charming gentleman, and within the first five for a master spirit and man of genius.  There were, indeed, certain stolidly conventional and superciliously official kinds of persons, both at home and abroad, who were incapable of looking beyond the clothes, and eyed him always with frozen suspicion.  This attitude used sometimes in youth to drive him into fits of flaming anger, which put him helplessly at a disadvantage unless, or until, he could call the sense of humour to his help.  For the rest, his human charm was the same for all kinds of people, without the least distinction of class or caste; for worldly wise old great ladies, whom he reminded of famous poets in their youth; for his brother artists and men of letters, perhaps, above all; for the ordinary clubman; for his physicians, who could never do enough for him; for domestic servants, who adored him; for the English policeman even, on whom he often tried, quite in vain, to pass himself as one of the criminal classes; for the common seaman, the shepherd, the street arab, or the tramp.  Even in the imposed silence and restraint of extreme sickness the magnetic power and attraction of the man made itself felt, and there seemed to be more vitality and fire of the spirit in him as he lay exhausted and speechless in bed than in an ordinary roomful of people in health.</p>
                  <p rend="justify">But I have strayed from my purpose, which is only to indicate that in the best of these letters of Stevenson’s you have some echo, far away indeed, but yet the nearest, of his talk—talk which could never be taken down, and has left only an ineffaceable impression in the memory of his friends.  The letters, it should be added, do not represent him at all fully until about the thirtieth year of his age, the beginning of the settled and married period of his life.  From then onwards, and especially from the beginning of Part VI. (the Hyères period), they present a pretty full and complete autobiography, if not of doings, at any rate of moods and feelings.  In the earlier periods, his correspondence for the most part expresses his real self either too little or else one-sidedly.  I have omitted very many letters of his boyish and student days as being too immature or uninteresting; and many of the confidences and confessions of his later youth, though they are those of a beautiful spirit, whether as too intimate, or as giving a disproportionate prominence to passing troubles.  When he is found in these days writing in a melancholy or minor key, it must be remembered that at the same moment, in direct intercourse with any friend, his spirits would instantly rise, and he would be found the gayest of laughing companions.  Very many letters or snatches of letters of nearly all dates to his familiars have also been omitted as not intelligible without a knowledge of the current jests, codes, and catchwords of conversation between him and them.  At one very interesting period of his life, from about his twenty-fifth to his twenty-ninth year, he disused the habit of letter-writing almost entirely.</p>
                  <p rend="justify">In choosing from among what remained I have used the best discretion that I could.  Stevenson’s feelings and relations throughout life were in almost all directions so warm and kindly, that next to nothing had to be suppressed from fear of giving pain.  On the other hand, he drew people towards him with so much confidence and affection, and met their openness with so much of his own, that an editor could not but feel the frequent risk of inviting readers to trespass too far on purely private affairs and feelings, including those of the living.  This was a point upon which in his lifetime he felt strongly.  That excellent critic, Mr. Walter Raleigh, has noticed, as one of the merits of Stevenson’s personal essays and accounts of travel, that few men have written more or more attractively of themselves without ever taking the public unduly into familiarity or overstepping proper bounds of reticence.  Public prying into private lives, the propagation of gossip by the press, and printing of private letters during the writer’s lifetime, were things he hated.  Once, indeed, he very superfluously gave himself a dangerous cold by dancing before a bonfire in his garden at the news of a ‘society’ editor having been committed to prison; and the only approach to a difference he ever had with one of his lifelong friends arose from the publication, without permission, of one of his letters written on his first Pacific voyage (see below, vol. ii. p. 121).</p>
                  <p rend="justify">How far, then, must I regard his instructions about publication as authorising me to go after his death beyond the limits which he had been so careful in observing and desiring others to observe in life?  How much may now fairly become public of that which had been held sacred and hitherto private among his friends?  To cut out all that is strictly personal and intimate were to leave his story untold and half the charm of his character unrevealed; to put in too much were to break all bonds of that privacy which he so carefully regarded while he lived.  I know not if I have at all been able to hit the mean, and to succeed in making these letters, as it has been my object to make them, present, without offence or intrusion, a just, a living, and a proportionate picture of the man, so far as they will yield it.  There is one respect in which his own practice and principle has had to be in some degree violated, if the work was to be done at all.  Except in the single case of the essay ‘Ordered South,’ he would never in writing for the public adopt the invalid point of view, or invite any attention to his infirmities.  ‘To me,’ he says, ‘the medicine bottles on my chimney and the blood on my handkerchief are accidents; they do not colour my view of life; and I should think myself a trifler and in bad taste if I introduced the world to these unimportant privacies.’  But from his letters to his family and friends, these matters could not possibly be quite left out.  The tale of his life, in the years when he was most of a correspondent, was in truth a tale of daily and nightly battle against weakness and physical distress and danger.  To those who loved him, the incidents of this battle were communicated, sometimes gravely, sometimes laughingly.  I have very greatly cut down such bulletins, but could not manage to omit them altogether.  Generally speaking, I have used the editorial privilege of omission without scruple where I thought it desirable.  And in regard to the text, I have not held myself bound to reproduce all the author’s minor eccentricities of spelling and the like.  As all his friends are aware, to spell in a quite accurate and grown-up manner was a thing which this master of English letters was never able to learn; but to reproduce such trivial slips in print is, I think, to distract the reader’s attention from the main matter.  A normal orthography has therefore been adopted throughout.</p>
                  <p rend="justify">Lastly, I have to express my thanks to my friend Mr. George Smith, proprietor of the <hi rend="italic">Dictionary of National Biography</hi>, for permission to reprint in this and in following sectional introductions a few paragraphs from that work.</p>

                     <head>INTRODUCTION.</head>
                     <p rend="justify">The following section consists chiefly of extracts from the correspondence and journals addressed by Louis Stevenson, as a lad of eighteen to twenty-two, to his father and mother during summer excursions to the Scottish coast or to the continent.  There exist enough of them to fill a volume; but it is not in letters of this kind to his family that a young man unbosoms himself most freely, and these are perhaps not quite devoid of the qualities of the guide-book and the descriptive exercise.  Nevertheless, they seem to me to contain enough signs of the future master-writer, enough of character, observation, and skill in expression, to make a few worth giving by way of an opening chapter to the present book.  Among them are interspersed one or two of a different character addressed to other correspondents.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">But, first, it is desirable that readers not acquainted with the circumstances and conditions of Stevenson’s parentage and early life should be here, as briefly as possible, informed of them.  On both sides of the house he came of capable and cultivated stock.  His grandfather was Robert Stevenson, civil engineer, highly distinguished as the builder of the Bell Rock lighthouse.  By this Robert Stevenson, his three sons, and two of his grandsons now living, the business of civil engineers in general, and of official engineers to the Commissioners of Northern Lights in particular, has been carried on at Edinburgh with high credit and public utility for almost a century.  Thomas Stevenson, the youngest of the three sons of the original Robert, was Robert Louis Stevenson’s father.  He was a man not only of mark, zeal, and inventiveness in his profession, but of a singularly interesting personality; a staunch friend and sagacious adviser, trenchant in judgment and demonstrative in emotion, outspoken, dogmatic,—despotic, even, in little things, but withal essentially chivalrous and soft-hearted; apt to pass with the swiftest transition from moods of gloom or sternness to those of tender or freakish gaiety, and commanding a gift of humorous and figurative speech second only to that of his more famous son.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Thomas Stevenson was married to Margaret Isabella, youngest daughter of the Rev. Lewis Balfour, for many years minister of the parish of Colinton in Midlothian.  This Mr. Balfour (described by his grandson in the essay called ‘The Manse’) was of the stock of the Balfours of Pilrig, and grandson to that James Balfour, professor first of moral philosophy, and afterwards of the law of nature and of nations, who was held in particular esteem as a philosophical controversialist by David Hume.  His wife, Henrietta Smith, a daughter of the Rev. George Smith of Galston, to whose gift as a preacher Burns refers scoffingly in the <hi rend="italic">Holy Fair</hi>, is said to have been a woman of uncommon beauty and charm of manner.  Their daughter, Mrs. Thomas Stevenson, suffered in early and middle life from chest and nerve troubles, and her son may have inherited from her some of his constitutional weakness as well as of his social and intellectual vivacity and his taste for letters.  Robert Louis (baptized Robert Lewis Balfour) Stevenson was born on November 13, 1850, at 8 Howard Place, Edinburgh, and was the only child of his parents.  His health was infirm from the first, and he was with difficulty kept alive by the combined care of a capable and watchful mother and a perfectly devoted nurse, Alison Cunningham; to whom his lifelong gratitude will be found touchingly expressed in the course of the following letters.  In 1858 he was near dying of a gastric fever, and was at all times subject to acute catarrhal and bronchial affections and extreme nervous excitability.  In January 1853 his parents moved to 1 Inverleith Terrace, and in May 1857 to 17 Heriot Row, which continued to be their Edinburgh home until the death of Thomas Stevenson in 1887.  Much of his time was also spent in the manse of Colinton on the Water of Leith, the home of his maternal grandfather.  Of this place his childish recollections were happy and idyllic, while those of city life were coloured rather by impressions of sickness, fever, and nocturnal terrors.  If, however, he suffered much as a child from the distresses, he also enjoyed to the full the pleasures, of imagination.  Illness confined him much within the house, but imagination kept him always content and busy.  In the days of the Crimean war some one gave the child a cheap toy sword; and when his father depreciated it, he said, ‘I tell you, the sword is of gold, and the sheath of silver, and the boy is very well off and quite contented.’  As disabilities closed in on him in after life, he would never grumble at any gift, however niggardly, of fortune, and the anecdote is as characteristic of the man as of the child.  He was eager and full of invention in every kind of play, whether solitary or sociable, and seems to have been treated as something of a small, sickly prince among a whole cousinhood of playmates of both the Balfour and the Stevenson connections.  He was also a greedy reader, or rather listener to reading; for it was not until his eighth year that he began to read easily or habitually to himself.  He has recorded how his first conscious impression of pleasure from the sound and cadence of words was received from certain passages in M‘Cheyne’s hymns as recited to him by his nurse.  Bible stories, the <hi rend="italic">Pilgrim’s Progress</hi>, and Mayne Reid’s tales were especially, and it would seem equally, his delight.  He began early to take pleasure in attempts at composition of his own.  A history of Moses, dictated in his sixth year, and an account of travels in Perth, in his ninth, are still extant.  Ill health prevented him getting much regular or continuous schooling.  He attended first (1858–61) a preparatory school kept by a Mr. Henderson in India Street; and next (at intervals for some time after the autumn of 1861) the Edinburgh Academy.  One of his tutors at the former school writes: ‘He was the most delightful boy I ever knew; full of fun, full of tender feeling, ready for his lessons, ready for a story, ready for fun.’  From very early days, both as child and boy, he must have had something of that power to charm which distinguished him above other men in after life.  ‘I loike that bo-o-o-o-y,’ a heavy Dutchman was heard saying to himself over and over again, whom at the age of about thirteen he had held in amused conversation during a whole passage from Ostend.  The same quality, with the signs which he always showed of quick natural intelligence when he chose to learn, must have helped to spare him many punishments from teachers which he earned by persistent and ingenious truantry.  ‘I think,’ remarks his mother, ‘they liked talking to him better than teaching him.’</p>
                     <p rend="justify">For a few months in the autumn of 1863, when his parents had been ordered to winter at Mentone for the sake of his mother’s health, he was sent to a boarding-school kept by a Mr. Wyatt at Spring Grove, near London.  It is not my intention to treat the reader to the series of childish and boyish letters of these days which parental fondness has preserved.  But here is one written from his English school when he was about thirteen, which is both amusing in itself and had a certain influence on his destiny, inasmuch as his appeal led to his being taken out to join his parents on the French Riviera; which from that day forward he never ceased to love, and for which the longing, amid the gloom of Edinburgh winters, often afterwards gripped him by the heart.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">Wick</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi>, <hi rend="italic">September</hi> 11, 1868.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR MOTHER,—. . . Wick lies at the end or elbow of an open triangular bay, hemmed on either side by shores, either cliff or steep earth-bank, of no great height.  The grey houses of Pulteney extend along the southerly shore almost to the cape; and it is about half-way down this shore—no, six-sevenths way down—that the new breakwater extends athwart the bay.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Certainly Wick in itself possesses no beauty: bare, grey shores, grim grey houses, grim grey sea; not even the gleam of red tiles; not even the greenness of a tree.  The southerly heights, when I came here, were black with people, fishers waiting on wind and night.  Now all the S.Y.S. (Stornoway boats) have beaten out of the bay, and the Wick men stay indoors or wrangle on the quays with dissatisfied fish-curers, knee-high in brine, mud, and herring refuse.  The day when the boats put out to go home to the Hebrides, the girl here told me there was ‘a black wind’; and on going out, I found the epithet as justifiable as it was picturesque.  A cold, <hi rend="italic">black</hi> southerly wind, with occasional rising showers of rain; it was a fine sight to see the boats beat out a-teeth of it.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">In Wick I have never heard any one greet his neighbour with the usual ‘Fine day’ or ‘Good morning.’  Both come shaking their heads, and both say, ‘Breezy, breezy!’  And such is the atrocious quality of the climate, that the remark is almost invariably justified by the fact.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">The streets are full of the Highland fishers, lubberly, stupid, inconceivably lazy and heavy to move.  You bruise against them, tumble over them, elbow them against the wall—all to no purpose; they will not budge; and you are forced to leave the pavement every step.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">To the south, however, is as fine a piece of coast scenery as I ever saw.  Great black chasms, huge black cliffs, rugged and over-hung gullies, natural arches, and deep green pools below them, almost too deep to let you see the gleam of sand among the darker weed: there are deep caves too.  In one of these lives a tribe of gipsies.  The men are <hi rend="italic">always</hi> drunk, simply and truthfully always.  From morning to evening the great villainous-looking fellows are either sleeping off the last debauch, or hulking about the cove ‘in the horrors.’  The cave is deep, high, and airy, and might be made comfortable enough.  But they just live among heaped boulders, damp with continual droppings from above, with no more furniture than two or three tin pans, a truss of rotten straw, and a few ragged cloaks.  In winter the surf bursts into the mouth and often forces them to abandon it.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">An <hi rend="italic">émeute</hi> of disappointed fishers was feared, and two ships of war are in the bay to render assistance to the municipal authorities.  This is the ides; and, to all intents and purposes, said ides are passed.  Still there is a good deal of disturbance, many drunk men, and a double supply of police.  I saw them sent for by some people and enter an inn, in a pretty good hurry: what it was for I do not know.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">You would see by papa’s letter about the carpenter who fell off the staging: I don’t think I was ever so much excited in my life.  The man was back at his work, and I asked him how he was; but he was a Highlander, and—need I add it?—dickens a word could I understand of his answer.  What is still worse, I find the people here-about—that is to say, the Highlanders, not the northmen—don’t understand <hi rend="italic">me</hi>.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I have lost a shilling’s worth of postage stamps, which has damped my ardour for buying big lots of ’em: I’ll buy them one at a time as I want ’em for the future.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">The Free Church minister and I got quite thick.  He left last night about two in the morning, when I went to turn in.  He gave me the enclosed.—I remain your affectionate son,</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR MOTHER,—The last two days have been dreadfully hard, and I was so tired in the evenings that I could not write.  In fact, last night I went to sleep immediately after dinner, or very nearly so.  My hours have been 10–2 and 3–7 out in the lighter or the small boat, in a long, heavy roll from the nor’-east.  When the dog was taken out, he got awfully ill; one of the men, Geordie Grant by name and surname, followed <hi rend="italic">shoot</hi> with considerable <hi rend="italic">éclat</hi>; but, wonderful to relate! I kept well.  My hands are all skinned, blistered, discoloured, and engrained with tar, some of which latter has established itself under my nails in a position of such natural strength that it defies all my efforts to dislodge it.  The worst work I had was when David (MacDonald’s eldest) and I took the charge ourselves.  He remained in the lighter to tighten or slacken the guys as we raised the pole towards the perpendicular, with two men.  I was with four men in the boat.  We dropped an anchor out a good bit, then tied a cord to the pole, took a turn round the sternmost thwart with it, and pulled on the anchor line.  As the great, big, wet hawser came in it soaked you to the skin: I was the sternest (used, by way of variety, for sternmost) of the lot, and had to coil it—a work which involved, from <hi rend="italic">its</hi> being so stiff and <hi rend="italic">your</hi> being busy pulling with all your might, no little trouble and an extra ducking.  We got it up; and, just as we were going to sing ‘Victory!’ one of the guys slipped in, the pole tottered—went over on its side again like a shot, and behold the end of our labour.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">You see, I have been roughing it; and though some parts of the letter may be neither very comprehensible nor very interesting to <hi rend="italic">you</hi>, I think that perhaps it might amuse Willie Traquair, who delights in all such dirty jobs.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">The first day, I forgot to mention, was like mid-winter for cold, and rained incessantly so hard that the livid white of our cold-pinched faces wore a sort of inflamed rash on the windward side.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I am not a bit the worse of it, except fore-mentioned state of hands, a slight crick in my neck from the rain running down, and general stiffness from pulling, hauling, and tugging for dear life.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">We have got double weights at the guys, and hope to get it up like a shot.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">What fun you three must be having!  I hope the cold don’t disagree with you.—I remain, my dear mother, your affectionate son,</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR MOTHER,—Another storm: wind higher, rain thicker: the wind still rising as the night closes in and the sea slowly rising along with it; it looks like a three days’ gale.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Last week has been a blank one: always too much sea.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I enjoyed myself very much last night at the R.’s.  There was a little dancing, much singing and supper.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Are you not well that you do not write?  I haven’t heard from you for more than a fortnight.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">The wind fell yesterday and rose again to-day; it is a dreadful evening; but the wind is keeping the sea down as yet.  Of course, nothing more has been done to the poles; and I can’t tell when I shall be able to leave, not for a fortnight yet, I fear, at the earliest, for the winds are persistent.  Where’s Murra?  Is Cummie struck dumb about the boots?  I wish you would get somebody to write an interesting letter and say how you are, for you’re on the broad of your back I see.  There hath arrived an inroad of farmers to-night; and I go to avoid them to M— if he’s disengaged, to the R.’s if not.</p>
                     <p rend="justify"> </p>
                     <p rend="justify">
                        <hi rend="italic">Sunday</hi> (<hi rend="italic">later</hi>).—Storm without: wind and rain: a confused mass of wind-driven rain-squalls, wind-ragged mist, foam, spray, and great, grey waves.  Of this hereafter; in the meantime let us follow the due course of historic narrative.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Seven P.M. found me at Breadalbane Terrace, clad in spotless blacks, white tie, shirt, et cætera, and finished off below with a pair of navvies’ boots.  How true that the devil is betrayed by his feet!  A message to Cummy at last.  Why, O treacherous woman! were my dress boots withheld?</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Dramatis personæ: père R., amusing, long-winded, in many points like papa; mère R., nice, delicate, likes hymns, knew Aunt Margaret (’t’ould man knew Uncle Alan); fille R., nommée Sara (no h), rather nice, lights up well, good voice, <hi rend="italic">interested</hi> face; Miss L., nice also, washed out a little, and, I think, a trifle sentimental; fils R., in a Leith office, smart, full of happy epithet, amusing.  They are very nice and very kind, asked me to come back—‘any night you feel dull; and any night doesn’t mean no night: we’ll be so glad to see you.’  <hi rend="italic">Cest la mère qui parle</hi>.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I was back there again to-night.  There was hymn-singing, and general religious controversy till eight, after which talk was secular.  Mrs. S. was deeply distressed about the boot business.  She consoled me by saying that many would be glad to have such feet whatever shoes they had on.  Unfortunately, fishers and seafaring men are too facile to be compared with!  This looks like enjoyment: better speck than Anster.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I have done with frivolity.  This morning I was awakened by Mrs. S. at the door.  ‘There’s a ship ashore at Shaltigoe!’  As my senses slowly flooded, I heard the whistling and the roaring of wind, and the lashing of gust-blown and uncertain flaws of rain.  I got up, dressed, and went out.  The mizzled sky and rain blinded you.</p>

                     <p rend="justify">C D is the new pier.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">A the schooner ashore.  B the salmon house.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">She was a Norwegian: coming in she saw our first gauge-pole, standing at point E. Norse skipper thought it was a sunk smack, and dropped his anchor in full drift of sea: chain broke: schooner came ashore.  Insured laden with wood: skipper owner of vessel and cargo bottom out.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I was in a great fright at first lest we should be liable; but it seems that’s all right.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Some of the waves were twenty feet high.  The spray rose eighty feet at the new pier.  Some wood has come ashore, and the roadway seems carried away.  There is something fishy at the far end where the cross wall is building; but till we are able to get along, all speculation is vain.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I am so sleepy I am writing nonsense.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I stood a long while on the cope watching the sea below me; I hear its dull, monotonous roar at this moment below the shrieking of the wind; and there came ever recurring to my mind the verse I am so fond of:—</p>
                     <p rend="justify">‘But yet the Lord that is on high<lb/>   Is more of might by far<lb/>Than noise of many waters is<lb/>   Or great sea-billows are.’</p>
                     <p rend="justify">The thunder at the wall when it first struck—the rush along ever growing higher—the great jet of snow-white spray some forty feet above you—and the ‘noise of many waters,’ the roar, the hiss, the ‘shrieking’ among the shingle as it fell head over heels at your feet.  I watched if it threw the big stones at the wall; but it never moved them.</p>
                     <p rend="justify"> </p>
                     <p rend="justify">
                        <hi rend="italic">Monday</hi>.—The end of the work displays gaps, cairns of ten ton blocks, stones torn from their places and turned right round.  The damage above water is comparatively little: what there may be below, <hi rend="italic">on ne sait pas encore</hi>.  The roadway is torn away, cross heads, broken planks tossed here and there, planks gnawn and mumbled as if a starved bear had been trying to eat them, planks with spales lifted from them as if they had been dressed with a rugged plane, one pile swaying to and fro clear of the bottom, the rails in one place sunk a foot at least.  This was not a great storm, the waves were light and short.  Yet when we are standing at the office, I felt the ground beneath me <hi rend="italic">quail</hi> as a huge roller thundered on the work at the last year’s cross wall.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">How could <hi rend="italic">noster amicus Q. maximus</hi> appreciate a storm at Wick?  It requires a little of the artistic temperament, of which Mr. T. S., <ref target="#1730040348670317495_622-h-3.htm.xhtml#footnote24">[24]</ref> C.E., possesses some, whatever he may say.  I can’t look at it practically however: that will come, I suppose, like grey hair or coffin nails.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Our pole is snapped: a fortnight’s work and the loss of the Norse schooner all for nothing!—except experience and dirty clothes.—Your affectionate son,</p>
                     <p rend="justify">R. L. Stevenson.</p>

                     <head>to Mrs. Churchill babington</head>
                     <p rend="justify">[<hi rend="italic">Swanston Cottage</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Lothianburn</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Summer</hi> 1871.]</p>
                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR MAUD,—If you have forgotten the hand-writing—as is like enough—you will find the name of a former correspondent (don’t know how to spell that word) at the end.  I have begun to write to you before now, but always stuck somehow, and left it to drown in a drawerful of like fiascos.  This time I am determined to carry through, though I have nothing specially to say.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">We look fairly like summer this morning; the trees are blackening out of their spring greens; the warmer suns have melted the hoarfrost of daisies of the paddock; and the blackbird, I fear, already beginning to ‘stint his pipe of mellower days’—which is very apposite (I can’t spell anything to-day—<hi rend="italic">one</hi> p or <hi rend="italic">two</hi>?) and pretty.  All the same, we have been having shocking weather—cold winds and grey skies.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I have been reading heaps of nice books; but I can’t go back so far.  I am reading Clarendon’s <hi rend="italic">Hist. Rebell.</hi> at present, with which I am more pleased than I expected, which is saying a good deal.  It is a pet idea of mine that one gets more real truth out of one avowed partisan than out of a dozen of your sham impartialists—wolves in sheep’s clothing—simpering honesty as they suppress documents.  After all, what one wants to know is not what people did, but why they did it—or rather, why they <hi rend="italic">thought</hi> they did it; and to learn that, you should go to the men themselves.  Their very falsehood is often more than another man’s truth.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I have possessed myself of Mrs. Hutchinson, which, of course, I admire, etc.  But is there not an irritating deliberation and correctness about her and everybody connected with her?  If she would only write bad grammar, or forget to finish a sentence, or do something or other that looks fallible, it would be a relief.  I sometimes wish the old Colonel had got drunk and beaten her, in the bitterness of my spirit.  I know I felt a weight taken off my heart when I heard he was extravagant.  It is quite possible to be too good for this evil world; and unquestionably, Mrs. Hutchinson was.  The way in which she talks of herself makes one’s blood run cold.  There—I am glad to have got that out—but don’t say it to anybody—seal of secrecy.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Please tell Mr. Babington that I have never forgotten one of his drawings—a Rubens, I think—a woman holding up a model ship.  That woman had more life in her than ninety per cent. of the lame humans that you see crippling about this earth.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">By the way, that is a feature in art which seems to have come in with the Italians.  Your old Greek statues have scarce enough vitality in them to keep their monstrous bodies fresh withal.  A shrewd country attorney, in a turned white neckcloth and rusty blacks, would just take one of these Agamemnons and Ajaxes quietly by his beautiful, strong arm, trot the unresisting statue down a little gallery of legal shams, and turn the poor fellow out at the other end, ‘naked, as from the earth he came.’  There is more latent life, more of the coiled spring in the sleeping dog, about a recumbent figure of Michael Angelo’s than about the most excited of Greek statues.  The very marble seems to wrinkle with a wild energy that we never feel except in dreams.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I think this letter has turned into a sermon, but I had nothing interesting to talk about.</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR CUMMY,—I was greatly pleased by your letter in many ways.  Of course, I was glad to hear from you; you know, you and I have so many old stories between us, that even if there was nothing else, even if there was not a very sincere respect and affection, we should always be glad to pass a nod.  I say ‘even if there was not.’  But you know right well there is.  Do not suppose that I shall ever forget those long, bitter nights, when I coughed and coughed and was so unhappy, and you were so patient and loving with a poor, sick child.  Indeed, Cummy, I wish I might become a man worth talking of, if it were only that you should not have thrown away your pains.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Happily, it is not the result of our acts that makes them brave and noble, but the acts themselves and the unselfish love that moved us to do them.  ‘Inasmuch as you have done it unto one of the least of these.’  My dear old nurse, and you know there is nothing a man can say nearer his heart except his mother or his wife—my dear old nurse, God will make good to you all the good that you have done, and mercifully forgive you all the evil.  And next time when the spring comes round, and everything is beginning once again, if you should happen to think that you might have had a child of your own, and that it was hard you should have spent so many years taking care of some one else’s prodigal, just you think this—you have been for a great deal in my life; you have made much that there is in me, just as surely as if you had conceived me; and there are sons who are more ungrateful to their own mothers than I am to you.  For I am not ungrateful, my dear Cummy, and it is with a very sincere emotion that I write myself your little boy,</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR BAXTER,—By the date you may perhaps understand the purport of my letter without any words wasted about the matter.  I cannot walk with you to-morrow, and you must not expect me.  I came yesterday afternoon to Bridge of Allan, and have been very happy ever since, as every place is sanctified by the eighth sense, Memory.  I walked up here this morning (three miles, <hi rend="italic">tu-dieu</hi>! a good stretch for me), and passed one of my favourite places in the world, and one that I very much affect in spirit when the body is tied down and brought immovably to anchor on a sickbed.  It is a meadow and bank on a corner on the river, and is connected in my mind inseparably with Virgil’s <hi rend="italic">Eclogues</hi>.  <hi rend="italic">Hic corulis mistos inter consedimus ulmos</hi>, or something very like that, the passage begins (only I know my short-winded Latinity must have come to grief over even this much of quotation); and here, to a wish, is just such a cavern as Menalcas might shelter himself withal from the bright noon, and, with his lips curled backward, pipe himself blue in the face, while <hi rend="italic">Messieurs les Arcadiens</hi> would roll out those cloying hexameters that sing themselves in one’s mouth to such a curious lifting chant.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">In such weather one has the bird’s need to whistle; and I, who am specially incompetent in this art, must content myself by chattering away to you on this bit of paper.  All the way along I was thanking God that he had made me and the birds and everything just as they are and not otherwise; for although there was no sun, the air was so thrilled with robins and blackbirds that it made the heart tremble with joy, and the leaves are far enough forward on the underwood to give a fine promise for the future.  Even myself, as I say, I would not have had changed in one <hi rend="italic">iota</hi> this forenoon, in spite of all my idleness and Guthrie’s lost paper, which is ever present with me—a horrible phantom.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">No one can be alone at home or in a quite new place.  Memory and you must go hand in hand with (at least) decent weather if you wish to cook up a proper dish of solitude.  It is in these little flights of mine that I get more pleasure than in anything else.  Now, at present, I am supremely uneasy and restless—almost to the extent of pain; but O! how I enjoy it, and how I <hi rend="italic">shall</hi> enjoy it afterwards (please God), if I get years enough allotted to me for the thing to ripen in.  When I am a very old and very respectable citizen with white hair and bland manners and a gold watch, I shall hear three crows cawing in my heart, as I heard them this morning: I vote for old age and eighty years of retrospect.  Yet, after all, I dare say, a short shrift and a nice green grave are about as desirable.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Poor devil! how I am wearying you!  Cheer up.  Two pages more, and my letter reaches its term, for I have no more paper.  What delightful things inns and waiters and bagmen are!  If we didn’t travel now and then, we should forget what the feeling of life is.  The very cushion of a railway carriage—‘the things restorative to the touch.’  I can’t write, confound it!  That’s because I am so tired with my walk.  Believe me, ever your affectionate friend,</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR BAXTER,—I don’t know what you mean.  I know nothing about the Standing Committee of the Spec., did not know that such a body existed, and even if it doth exist, must sadly repudiate all association with such ‘goodly fellowship.’  I am a ‘Rural Voluptuary’ at present.  <hi rend="italic">That</hi> is what is the matter with me.  The Spec. may go whistle.  As for ‘C. Baxter, Esq.,’ who is he?  ‘One Baxter, or Bagster, a secretary,’ I say to mine acquaintance, ‘is at present disquieting my leisure with certain illegal, uncharitable, unchristian, and unconstitutional documents called <hi rend="italic">Business Letters</hi>: <hi rend="italic">The affair is in the hands of the Police</hi>.’  Do you hear <hi rend="italic">that</hi>, you evildoer?  Sending business letters is surely a far more hateful and slimy degree of wickedness than sending threatening letters; the man who throws grenades and torpedoes is less malicious; the Devil in red-hot hell rubs his hands with glee as he reckons up the number that go forth spreading pain and anxiety with each delivery of the post.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I have been walking to-day by a colonnade of beeches along the brawling Allan.  My character for sanity is quite gone, seeing that I cheered my lonely way with the following, in a triumphant chaunt: ‘Thank God for the grass, and the fir-trees, and the crows, and the sheep, and the sunshine, and the shadows of the fir-trees.’  I hold that he is a poor mean devil who can walk alone, in such a place and in such weather, and doesn’t set up his lungs and cry back to the birds and the river.  Follow, follow, follow me.  Come hither, come hither, come hither—here shall you see—no enemy—except a very slight remnant of winter and its rough weather.  My bedroom, when I awoke this morning, was full of bird-songs, which is the greatest pleasure in life.  Come hither, come hither, come hither, and when you come bring the third part of the <hi rend="italic">Earthly Paradise</hi>; you can get it for me in Elliot’s for two and tenpence (2s. 10d.)

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR MOTHER,—I am here at last, sitting in my room, without coat or waistcoat, and with both window and door open, and yet perspiring like a terra-cotta jug or a Gruyère cheese.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">We had a very good passage, which we certainly deserved, in compensation for having to sleep on cabin floor, and finding absolutely nothing fit for human food in the whole filthy embarkation.  We made up for lost time by sleeping on deck a good part of the forenoon.  When I woke, Simpson was still sleeping the sleep of the just, on a coil of ropes and (as appeared afterwards) his own hat; so I got a bottle of Bass and a pipe and laid hold of an old Frenchman of somewhat filthy aspect (<hi rend="italic">fiat</hi> 
                        <hi rend="italic">experimentum in corpore vili</hi>) to try my French upon.  I made very heavy weather of it.  The Frenchman had a very pretty young wife; but my French always deserted me entirely when I had to answer her, and so she soon drew away and left me to her lord, who talked of French politics, Africa, and domestic economy with great vivacity.  From Ostend a smoking-hot journey to Brussels.  At Brussels we went off after dinner to the Parc.  If any person wants to be happy, I should advise the Parc.  You sit drinking iced drinks and smoking penny cigars under great old trees.  The band place, covered walks, etc., are all lit up.  And you can’t fancy how beautiful was the contrast of the great masses of lamplit foliage and the dark sapphire night sky with just one blue star set overhead in the middle of the largest patch.  In the dark walks, too, there are crowds of people whose faces you cannot see, and here and there a colossal white statue at the corner of an alley that gives the place a nice, <hi rend="italic">artificial</hi>, eighteenth century sentiment.  There was a good deal of summer lightning blinking overhead, and the black avenues and white statues leapt out every minute into short-lived distinctness.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I get up to add one thing more.  There is in the hotel a boy in whom I take the deepest interest.  I cannot tell you his age, but the very first time I saw him (when I was at dinner yesterday) I was very much struck with his appearance.  There is something very leonine in his face, with a dash of the negro especially, if I remember aright, in the mouth.  He has a great quantity of dark hair, curling in great rolls, not in little corkscrews, and a pair of large, dark, and very steady, bold, bright eyes.  His manners are those of a prince.  I felt like an overgrown ploughboy beside him.  He speaks English perfectly, but with, I think, sufficient foreign accent to stamp him as a Russian, especially when his manners are taken into account.  I don’t think I ever saw any one who looked like a hero before.  After breakfast this morning I was talking to him in the court, when he mentioned casually that he had caught a snake in the Riesengebirge.  ‘I have it here,’ he said; ‘would you like to see it?’  I said yes; and putting his hand into his breast-pocket, he drew forth not a dried serpent skin, but the head and neck of the reptile writhing and shooting out its horrible tongue in my face.  You may conceive what a fright I got.  I send off this single sheet just now in order to let you know I am safe across; but you must not expect letters often.</p>

                     <p rend="justify">. . . Last night I met with rather an amusing adventurette.  Seeing a church door open, I went in, and was led by most importunate finger-bills up a long stair to the top of the tower.  The father smoking at the door, the mother and the three daughters received me as if I was a friend of the family and had come in for an evening visit.  The youngest daughter (about thirteen, I suppose, and a pretty little girl) had been learning English at the school, and was anxious to play it off upon a real, veritable Englander; so we had a long talk, and I was shown photographs, etc., Marie and I talking, and the others looking on with evident delight at having such a linguist in the family.  As all my remarks were duly translated and communicated to the rest, it was quite a good German lesson.  There was only one contretemps during the whole interview—the arrival of another visitor, in the shape (surely) the last of God’s creatures, a wood-worm of the most unnatural and hideous appearance, with one great striped horn sticking out of his nose like a boltsprit.  If there are many wood-worms in Germany, I shall come home.  The most courageous men in the world must be entomologists.  I had rather be a lion-tamer.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">To-day I got rather a curiosity—<hi rend="italic">Lieder und Balladen von Robert Burns</hi>, translated by one Silbergleit, and not so ill done either.  Armed with which, I had a swim in the Main, and then bread and cheese and Bavarian beer in a sort of café, or at least the German substitute for a café; but what a falling off after the heavenly forenoons in Brussels!</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I have bought a meerschaum out of local sentiment, and am now very low and nervous about the bargain, having paid dearer than I should in England, and got a worse article, if I can form a judgment.</p>

                     <p rend="justify">. . . Yesterday I walked to Eckenheim, a village a little way out of Frankfurt, and turned into the alehouse.  In the room, which was just such as it would have been in Scotland, were the landlady, two neighbours, and an old peasant eating raw sausage at the far end.  I soon got into conversation; and was astonished when the landlady, having asked whether I were an Englishman, and received an answer in the affirmative, proceeded to inquire further whether I were not also a Scotchman.  It turned out that a Scotch doctor—a professor—a poet—who wrote books—<hi rend="italic">gross wie das</hi>—had come nearly every day out of Frankfurt to the <hi rend="italic">Eckenheimer Wirthschaft</hi>, and had left behind him a most savoury memory in the hearts of all its customers.  One man ran out to find his name for me, and returned with the news that it was <hi rend="italic">Cobie</hi> (Scobie, I suspect); and during his absence the rest were pouring into my ears the fame and acquirements of my countryman.  He was, in some undecipherable manner, connected with the Queen of England and one of the Princesses.  He had been in Turkey, and had there married a wife of immense wealth.  They could find apparently no measure adequate to express the size of his books.  In one way or another, he had amassed a princely fortune, and had apparently only one sorrow, his daughter to wit, who had absconded into a <hi rend="italic">kloster</hi>, with a considerable slice of the mother’s <hi rend="italic">geld</hi>.  I told them we had no klosters in Scotland, with a certain feeling of superiority.  No more had they, I was told—‘<hi rend="italic">Hier ist unser Kloster</hi>!’ and the speaker motioned with both arms round the taproom.  Although the first torrent was exhausted, yet the Doctor came up again in all sorts of ways, and with or without occasion, throughout the whole interview; as, for example, when one man, taking his pipe out of his mouth and shaking his head, remarked <hi rend="italic">àpropos</hi> of nothing and with almost defiant conviction, ‘<hi rend="italic">Er war ein </hi>
                        <hi rend="italic">feiner Mann</hi>, <hi rend="italic">der Herr Doctor</hi>,’ and was answered by another with ‘<hi rend="italic">Yaw</hi>, <hi rend="italic">yaw</hi>, <hi rend="italic">und trank immer rothen Wein</hi>.’</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Setting aside the Doctor, who had evidently turned the brains of the entire village, they were intelligent people.  One thing in particular struck me, their honesty in admitting that here they spoke bad German, and advising me to go to Coburg or Leipsic for German.—‘<hi rend="italic">Sie sprechen da rein</hi>’ (clean), said one; and they all nodded their heads together like as many mandarins, and repeated <hi rend="italic">rein</hi>, <hi rend="italic">so rein</hi> in chorus.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Of course we got upon Scotland.  The hostess said, ‘<hi rend="italic">Die Schottländer trinken gern Schnapps</hi>,’ which may be freely translated, ‘Scotchmen are horrid fond of whisky.’  It was impossible, of course, to combat such a truism; and so I proceeded to explain the construction of toddy, interrupted by a cry of horror when I mentioned the <hi rend="italic">hot</hi> water; and thence, as I find is always the case, to the most ghastly romancing about Scottish scenery and manners, the Highland dress, and everything national or local that I could lay my hands upon.  Now that I have got my German Burns, I lean a good deal upon him for opening a conversation, and read a few translations to every yawning audience that I can gather.  I am grown most insufferably national, you see.  I fancy it is a punishment for my want of it at ordinary times.  Now, what do you think, there was a waiter in this very hotel, but, alas! he is now gone, who sang (from morning to night, as my informant said with a shrug at the recollection) what but <hi rend="italic">‘s ist lange her</hi>, the German version of Auld Lang Syne; so you see, madame, the finest lyric ever written will make its way out of whatsoever corner of patois it found its birth in.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">‘<hi rend="italic">Meitz Herz ist im Hochland</hi>, <hi rend="italic">mean Herz ist nicht hier</hi>,<lb/>
                        <hi rend="italic">Mein Herz ist im Hochland im grünen Revier</hi>.<lb/>

                     <p rend="justify">I don’t think I need translate that for you.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">There is one thing that burthens me a good deal in my patriotic garrulage, and that is the black ignorance in which I grope about everything, as, for example, when I gave yesterday a full and, I fancy, a startlingly incorrect account of Scotch education to a very stolid German on a garden bench: he sat and perspired under it, however with much composure.  I am generally glad enough to fall back again, after these political interludes, upon Burns, toddy, and the Highlands.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I go every night to the theatre, except when there is no opera.  I cannot stand a play yet; but I am already very much improved, and can understand a good deal of what goes on.</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR FATHER,—You will perceive by the head of this page that we have at last got into lodgings, and powerfully mean ones too.  If I were to call the street anything but <hi rend="italic">shady</hi>, I should be boasting.  The people sit at their doors in shirt-sleeves, smoking as they do in Seven Dials of a Sunday.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Last night we went to bed about ten, for the first time <hi rend="italic">householders</hi> in Germany—real Teutons, with no deception, spring, or false bottom.  About half-past one there began such a trumpeting, shouting, pealing of bells, and scurrying hither and thither of feet as woke every person in Frankfurt out of their first sleep with a vague sort of apprehension that the last day was at hand.  The whole street was alive, and we could hear people talking in their rooms, or crying to passers-by from their windows, all around us.  At last I made out what a man was saying in the next room.  It was a fire in Sachsenhausen, he said (Sachsenhausen is the suburb on the other side of the Main), and he wound up with one of the most tremendous falsehoods on record, ‘<hi rend="italic">Hier alles ruht</hi>—here all is still.’  If it can be said to be still in an engine factory, or in the stomach of a volcano when it is meditating an eruption, he might have been justified in what he said, but not otherwise.  The tumult continued unabated for near an hour; but as one grew used to it, it gradually resolved itself into three bells, answering each other at short intervals across the town, a man shouting, at ever shorter intervals and with superhuman energy, ‘<hi rend="italic">Feuer</hi>,—<hi rend="italic">im Sachsenhausen</hi>, and the almost continuous winding of all manner of bugles and trumpets, sometimes in stirring flourishes, and sometimes in mere tuneless wails.  Occasionally there was another rush of feet past the window, and once there was a mighty drumming, down between us and the river, as though the soldiery were turning out to keep the peace.  This was all we had of the fire, except a great cloud, all flushed red with the glare, above the roofs on the other side of the Gasse; but it was quite enough to put me entirely off my sleep and make me keenly alive to three or four gentlemen who were strolling leisurely about my person, and every here and there leaving me somewhat as a keepsake. . . . However, everything has its compensation, and when day came at last, and the sparrows awoke with trills and <hi rend="italic">carol-ets</hi>, the dawn seemed to fall on me like a sleeping draught.  I went to the window and saw the sparrows about the eaves, and a great troop of doves go strolling up the paven Gasse, seeking what they may devour.  And so to sleep, despite fleas and fire-alarms and clocks chiming the hours out of neighbouring houses at all sorts of odd times and with the most charming want of unanimity.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">We have got settled down in Frankfurt, and like the place very much.  Simpson and I seem to get on very well together.  We suit each other capitally; and it is an awful joke to be living (two would-be advocates, and one a baronet) in this supremely mean abode.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">The abode is, however, a great improvement on the hotel, and I think we shall grow quite fond of it.—Ever your affectionate son,</p>

                     <p rend="justify">. . . Last night I was at the theatre and heard <hi rend="italic">Die Judin</hi> (<hi rend="italic">La Juive</hi>), and was thereby terribly excited.  At last, in the middle of the fifth act, which was perfectly beastly, I had to slope.  I could stand even seeing the cauldron with the sham fire beneath, and the two hateful executioners in red; but when at last the girl’s courage breaks down, and, grasping her father’s arm, she cries out—O so shudderfully!—I thought it high time to be out of that <hi rend="italic">galère</hi>, and so I do not know yet whether it ends well or ill; but if I ever afterwards find that they do carry things to the extremity, I shall think more meanly of my species.  It was raining and cold outside, so I went into a <hi rend="italic">Bierhalle</hi>, and sat and brooded over a <hi rend="italic">Schnitt</hi> (half-glass) for nearly an hour.  An opera is far more <hi rend="italic">real</hi> than real life to me.  It seems as if stage illusion, and particularly this hardest to swallow and most conventional illusion of them all—an opera—would never stale upon me.  I wish that life was an opera.  I should like to <hi rend="italic">live</hi> in one; but I don’t know in what quarter of the globe I shall find a society so constituted.  Besides, it would soon pall: imagine asking for three-kreuzer cigars in recitative, or giving the washerwoman the inventory of your dirty clothes in a sustained and <hi rend="italic">flourishous</hi> aria.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I am in a right good mood this morning to sit here and write to you; but not to give you news.  There is a great stir of life, in a quiet, almost country fashion, all about us here.  Some one is hammering a beef-steak in the <hi rend="italic">rez-de-chaussée</hi>: there is a great clink of pitchers and noise of the pump-handle at the public well in the little square-kin round the corner.  The children, all seemingly within a month, and certainly none above five, that always go halting and stumbling up and down the roadway, are ordinarily very quiet, and sit sedately puddling in the gutter, trying, I suppose, poor little devils! to understand their <hi rend="italic">Muttersprache</hi>; but they, too, make themselves heard from time to time in little incomprehensible antiphonies, about the drift that comes down to them by their rivers from the strange lands higher up the Gasse.  Above all, there is here such a twittering of canaries (I can see twelve out of our window), and such continual visitation of grey doves and big-nosed sparrows, as make our little bye-street into a perfect aviary.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I look across the Gasse at our opposite neighbour, as he dandles his baby about, and occasionally takes a spoonful or two of some pale slimy nastiness that looks like <hi rend="italic">dead porridge</hi>, if you can take the conception.  These two are his only occupations.  All day long you can hear him singing over the brat when he is not eating; or see him eating when he is not keeping baby.  Besides which, there comes into his house a continual round of visitors that puts me in mind of the luncheon hour at home.  As he has thus no ostensible avocation, we have named him ‘the W.S.’ to give a flavour of respectability to the street.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Enough of the Gasse.  The weather is here much colder.  It rained a good deal yesterday; and though it is fair and sunshiny again to-day, and we can still sit, of course, with our windows open, yet there is no more excuse for the siesta; and the bathe in the river, except for cleanliness, is no longer a necessity of life.  The Main is very swift.  In one part of the baths it is next door to impossible to swim against it, and I suspect that, out in the open, it would be quite impossible.—Adieu, my dear mother, and believe me, ever your affectionate son,</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR BAXTER,—The thunderbolt has fallen with a vengeance now.  On Friday night after leaving you, in the course of conversation, my father put me one or two questions as to beliefs, which I candidly answered.  I really hate all lying so much now—a new found honesty that has somehow come out of my late illness—that I could not so much as hesitate at the time; but if I had foreseen the real hell of everything since, I think I should have lied, as I have done so often before.  I so far thought of my father, but I had forgotten my mother.  And now! they are both ill, both silent, both as down in the mouth as if—I can find no simile.  You may fancy how happy it is for me.  If it were not too late, I think I could almost find it in my heart to retract, but it is too late; and again, am I to live my whole life as one falsehood?  Of course, it is rougher than hell upon my father, but can I help it?  They don’t see either that my game is not the light-hearted scoffer; that I am not (as they call me) a careless infidel.  I believe as much as they do, only generally in the inverse ratio: I am, I think, as honest as they can be in what I hold.  I have not come hastily to my views.  I reserve (as I told them) many points until I acquire fuller information, and do not think I am thus justly to be called ‘horrible atheist.’</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Now, what is to take place?  What a curse I am to my parents!  O Lord, what a pleasant thing it is to have just <hi rend="italic">damned</hi> the happiness of (probably) the only two people who care a damn about you in the world.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">What is my life to be at this rate?  What, you rascal?  Answer—I have a pistol at your throat.  If all that I hold true and most desire to spread is to be such death, and a worse than death, in the eyes of my father and mother, what the <hi rend="italic">devil</hi> am I to do?</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Here is a good heavy cross with a vengeance, and all rough with rusty nails that tear your fingers, only it is not I that have to carry it alone; I hold the light end, but the heavy burden falls on these two.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Don’t—I don’t know what I was going to say.  I am an abject idiot, which, all things considered, is not remarkable.—Ever your affectionate and horrible atheist,</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR MOTHER,—I am too happy to be much of a correspondent.  Yesterday we were away to Melford and Lavenham, both exceptionally placid, beautiful old English towns.  Melford scattered all round a big green, with an Elizabethan Hall and Park, great screens of trees that seem twice as high as trees should seem, and everything else like what ought to be in a novel, and what one never expects to see in reality, made me cry out how good we were to live in Scotland, for the many hundredth time.  I cannot get over my astonishment—indeed, it increases every day—at the hopeless gulf that there is between England and Scotland, and English and Scotch.  Nothing is the same; and I feel as strange and outlandish here as I do in France or Germany.  Everything by the wayside, in the houses, or about the people, strikes me with an unexpected unfamiliarity: I walk among surprises, for just where you think you have them, something wrong turns up.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I got a little Law read yesterday, and some German this morning, but on the whole there are too many amusements going for much work; as for correspondence, I have neither heart nor time for it to-day.</p>

                     <p rend="justify">I have been to-day a very long walk with my father through some of the most beautiful ways hereabouts; the day was cold with an iron, windy sky, and only glorified now and then with autumn sunlight.  For it is fully autumn with us, with a blight already over the greens, and a keen wind in the morning that makes one rather timid of one’s tub when it finds its way indoors.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I was out this evening to call on a friend, and, coming back through the wet, crowded, lamp-lit streets, was singing after my own fashion, <hi rend="italic">Du hast Diamanten und</hi> 
                        <hi rend="italic">Perlen</hi>, when I heard a poor cripple man in the gutter wailing over a pitiful Scotch air, his club-foot supported on the other knee, and his whole woebegone body propped sideways against a crutch.  The nearest lamp threw a strong light on his worn, sordid face and the three boxes of lucifer matches that he held for sale.  My own false notes stuck in my chest.  How well off I am! is the burthen of my songs all day long—<hi rend="italic">Drum ist so wohl mir in der Welt</hi>! and the ugly reality of the cripple man was an intrusion on the beautiful world in which I was walking.  He could no more sing than I could; and his voice was cracked and rusty, and altogether perished.  To think that that wreck may have walked the streets some night years ago, as glad at heart as I was, and promising himself a future as golden and honourable!</p>
                     <p rend="justify">
                        <hi rend="italic">Sunday</hi>, 11.20 <hi rend="italic">a.m.</hi>—I wonder what you are doing now?—in church likely, at the <hi rend="italic">Te Deum</hi>.  Everything here is utterly silent.  I can hear men’s footfalls streets away; the whole life of Edinburgh has been sucked into sundry pious edifices; the gardens below my windows are steeped in a diffused sunlight, and every tree seems standing on tiptoes, strained and silent, as though to get its head above its neighbour’s and <hi rend="italic">listen</hi>.  You know what I mean, don’t you?  How trees do seem silently to assert themselves on an occasion!  I have been trying to write <hi rend="italic">Roads</hi> until I feel as if I were standing on my head; but I mean <hi rend="italic">Roads</hi>, and shall do something to them.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I wish I could make you feel the hush that is over everything, only made the more perfect by rare interruptions; and the rich, placid light, and the still, autumnal foliage.  Houses, you know, stand all about our gardens: solid, steady blocks of houses; all look empty and asleep.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">
                        <hi rend="italic">Monday night</hi>.—The drums and fifes up in the Castle are sounding the guard-call through the dark, and there is a great rattle of carriages without.  I have had (I must tell you) my bed taken out of this room, so that I am alone in it with my books and two tables, and two chairs, and a coal-skuttle (or <hi rend="italic">scuttle</hi>) (?) and a <hi rend="italic">débris</hi> of broken pipes in a corner, and my old school play-box, so full of papers and books that the lid will not shut down, standing reproachfully in the midst.  There is something in it that is still a little gaunt and vacant; it needs a little populous disorder over it to give it the feel of homeliness, and perhaps a bit more furniture, just to take the edge off the sense of illimitable space, eternity, and a future state, and the like, that is brought home to one, even in this small attic, by the wide, empty floor.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">You would require to know, what only I can ever know, many grim and many maudlin passages out of my past life to feel how great a change has been made for me by this past summer.  Let me be ever so poor and thread-paper a soul, I am going to try for the best.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">These good booksellers of mine have at last got a <hi rend="italic">Werther</hi> without illustrations.  I want you to like Charlotte.  Werther himself has every feebleness and vice that could tend to make his suicide a most virtuous and commendable action; and yet I like Werther too—I don’t know why, except that he has written the most delightful letters in the world.  Note, by the way, the passage under date June 21st not far from the beginning; it finds a voice for a great deal of dumb, uneasy, pleasurable longing that we have all had, times without number.  I looked that up the other day for <hi rend="italic">Roads</hi>, so I know the reference; but you will find it a garden of flowers from beginning to end.  All through the passion keeps steadily rising, from the thunderstorm at the country-house—there was thunder in that story too—up to the last wild delirious interview; either Lotte was no good at all, or else Werther should have remained alive after that; either he knew his woman too well, or else he was precipitate.  But an idiot like that is hopeless; and yet, he wasn’t an idiot—I make reparation, and will offer eighteen pounds of best wax at his tomb.  Poor devil! he was only the weakest—or, at least, a very weak strong man.</p>

                     <p rend="justify">. . . I was over last night, contrary to my own wish, in Leven, Fife; and this morning I had a conversation of which, I think, some account might interest you.  I was up with a cousin who was fishing in a mill-lade, and a shower of rain drove me for shelter into a tumbledown steading attached to the mill.  There I found a labourer cleaning a byre, with whom I fell into talk.  The man was to all appearance as heavy, as <hi rend="italic">hébété</hi>, as any English clodhopper; but I knew I was in Scotland, and launched out forthright into Education and Politics and the aims of one’s life.  I told him how I had found the peasantry in Suffolk, and added that their state had made me feel quite pained and down-hearted.  ‘It but to do that,’ he said, ‘to onybody that thinks at a’!’  Then, again, he said that he could not conceive how anything could daunt or cast down a man who had an aim in life.  ‘They that have had a guid schoolin’ and do nae mair, whatever they do, they have done; but him that has aye something ayont need never be weary.’  I have had to mutilate the dialect much, so that it might be comprehensible to you; but I think the sentiment will keep, even through a change of words, something of the heartsome ring of encouragement that it had for me: and that from a man cleaning a byre!  You see what John Knox and his schools have done.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">
                        <hi rend="italic">Saturday</hi>.—This has been a charming day for me from morning to now (5 P.M.).  First, I found your letter, and went down and read it on a seat in those Public Gardens of which you have heard already.  After lunch, my father and I went down to the coast and walked a little way along the shore between Granton and Cramond.  This has always been with me a very favourite walk.  The Firth closes gradually together before you, the coast runs in a series of the most beautifully moulded bays, hill after hill, wooded and softly outlined, trends away in front till the two shores join together.  When the tide is out there are great, gleaming flats of wet sand, over which the gulls go flying and crying; and every cape runs down into them with its little spit of wall and trees.  We lay together a long time on the beach; the sea just babbled among the stones; and at one time we heard the hollow, sturdy beat of the paddles of an unseen steamer somewhere round the cape.  I am glad to say that the peace of the day and scenery was not marred by any unpleasantness between us two.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I am, unhappily, off my style, and can do nothing well; indeed, I fear I have marred <hi rend="italic">Roads</hi> finally by patching at it when I was out of the humour.  Only, I am beginning to see something great about John Knox and Queen Mary: I like them both so much, that I feel as if I could write the history fairly.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I have finished <hi rend="italic">Roads</hi> to-day, and send it off to you to see.  The Lord knows whether it is worth anything!—some of it pleases me a good deal, but I fear it is quite unfit for any possible magazine.  However, I wish you to see it, as you know the humour in which it was conceived, walking alone and very happily about the Suffolk highways and byeways on several splendid sunny afternoons.—Believe me, ever your faithful friend,</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">Monday</hi>.—I have looked over <hi rend="italic">Roads</hi> again, and I am aghast at its feebleness.  It is the trial of a very ‘’prentice hand’ indeed.  Shall I ever learn to do anything well?  However, it shall go to you, for the reasons given above.</p>

                     <p rend="justify">. . . I must be very strong to have all this vexation and still to be well.  I was weighed the other day, and the gross weight of my large person was eight stone six!  Does it not seem surprising that I can keep the lamp alight, through all this gusty weather, in so frail a lantern?  And yet it burns cheerily.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">My mother is leaving for the country this morning, and my father and I will be alone for the best part of the week in this house.  Then on Friday I go south to Dumfries till Monday.  I must write small, or I shall have a tremendous budget by then.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">7.20 <hi rend="italic">p.m.</hi>—I must tell you a thing I saw to-day.  I was going down to Portobello in the train, when there came into the next compartment (third class) an artisan, strongly marked with smallpox, and with sunken, heavy eyes—a face hard and unkind, and without anything lovely.  There was a woman on the platform seeing him off.  At first sight, with her one eye blind and the whole cast of her features strongly plebeian, and even vicious, she seemed as unpleasant as the man; but there was something beautifully soft, a sort of light of tenderness, as on some Dutch Madonna, that came over her face when she looked at the man.  They talked for a while together through the window; the man seemed to have been asking money.  ‘Ye ken the last time,’ she said, ‘I gave ye two shillin’s for your ludgin’, and ye said—’ it died off into whisper.  Plainly Falstaff and Dame Quickly over again.  The man laughed unpleasantly, even cruelly, and said something; and the woman turned her back on the carriage and stood a long while so, and, do what I might, I could catch no glimpse of her expression, although I thought I saw the heave of a sob in her shoulders.  At last, after the train was already in motion, she turned round and put two shillings into his hand.  I saw her stand and look after us with a perfect heaven of love on her face—this poor one-eyed Madonna—until the train was out of sight; but the man, sordidly happy with his gains, did not put himself to the inconvenience of one glance to thank her for her ill-deserved kindness.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I have been up at the Spec. and looked out a reference I wanted.  The whole town is drowned in white, wet vapour off the sea.  Everything drips and soaks.  The very statues seem wet to the skin.  I cannot pretend to be very cheerful; I did not see one contented face in the streets; and the poor did look so helplessly chill and dripping, without a stitch to change, or so much as a fire to dry themselves at, or perhaps money to buy a meal, or perhaps even a bed.  My heart shivers for them.</p>
                     <p rend="justify"> </p>
                     <p rend="justify">
                        <hi rend="italic">Dumfries</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Friday</hi>.—All my thirst for a little warmth, a little sun, a little corner of blue sky avails nothing.  Without, the rain falls with a long drawn <hi rend="italic">swish</hi>, and the night is as dark as a vault.  There is no wind indeed, and that is a blessed change after the unruly, bedlamite gusts that have been charging against one round street corners and utterly abolishing and destroying all that is peaceful in life.  Nothing sours my temper like these coarse termagant winds.  I hate practical joking; and your vulgarest practical joker is your flaw of wind.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I have tried to write some verses; but I find I have nothing to say that has not been already perfectly said and perfectly sung in <hi rend="italic">Adelaïde</hi>.  I have so perfect an idea out of that song!  The great Alps, a wonder in the starlight—the river, strong from the hills, and turbulent, and loudly audible at night—the country, a scented <hi rend="italic">Frühlingsgarten</hi> of orchards and deep wood where the nightingales harbour—a sort of German flavour over all—and this love-drunken man, wandering on by sleeping village and silent town, pours out of his full heart, <hi rend="italic">Einst</hi>, <hi rend="italic">O Wunder</hi>, <hi rend="italic">einst</hi>, etc.  I wonder if I am wrong about this being the most beautiful and perfect thing in the world—the only marriage of really accordant words and music—both drunk with the same poignant, unutterable sentiment.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">To-day in Glasgow my father went off on some business, and my mother and I wandered about for two hours.  We had lunch together, and were very merry over what the people at the restaurant would think of us—mother and son they could not suppose us to be.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">Saturday</hi>.—And to-day it came—warmth, sunlight, and a strong, hearty living wind among the trees.  I found myself a new being.  My father and I went off a long walk, through a country most beautifully wooded and various, under a range of hills.  You should have seen one place where the wood suddenly fell away in front of us down a long, steep hill between a double row of trees, with one small fair-haired child framed in shadow in the foreground; and when we got to the foot there was the little kirk and kirkyard of Irongray, among broken fields and woods by the side of the bright, rapid river.  In the kirkyard there was a wonderful congregation of tombstones, upright and recumbent on four legs (after our Scotch fashion), and of flat-armed fir-trees.  One gravestone was erected by Scott (at a cost, I learn, of £70) to the poor woman who served him as heroine in the <hi rend="italic">Heart of Midlothian</hi>, and the inscription in its stiff, Jedediah Cleishbotham fashion is not without something touching. <ref target="#1730040348670317495_622-h-3.htm.xhtml#footnote56">[56]</ref>  We went up the stream a little further to where two Covenanters lie buried in an oakwood; the tombstone (as the custom is) containing the details of their grim little tragedy in funnily bad rhyme, one verse of which sticks in my memory:—</p>
                     <p rend="justify">‘We died, their furious rage to stay,<lb/>Near to the kirk of Iron-gray.’</p>
                     <p rend="justify">We then fetched a long compass round about through Holywood Kirk and Lincluden ruins to Dumfries.  But the walk came sadly to grief as a pleasure excursion before our return . . .</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">Sunday</hi>.—Another beautiful day.  My father and I walked into Dumfries to church.  When the service was done I noted the two halberts laid against the pillar of the churchyard gate; and as I had not seen the little weekly pomp of civic dignitaries in our Scotch country towns for some years, I made my father wait.  You should have seen the provost and three bailies going stately away down the sunlit street, and the two town servants strutting in front of them, in red coats and cocked hats, and with the halberts most conspicuously shouldered.  We saw Burns’s house—a place that made me deeply sad—and spent the afternoon down the banks of the Nith.  I had not spent a day by a river since we lunched in the meadows near Sudbury.  The air was as pure and clear and sparkling as spring water; beautiful, graceful outlines of hill and wood shut us in on every side; and the swift, brown river fled smoothly away from before our eyes, rippled over with oily eddies and dimples.  White gulls had come up from the sea to fish, and hovered and flew hither and thither among the loops of the stream.  By good fortune, too, it was a dead calm between my father and me.</p>

                     <p rend="justify">It is a little sharp to-day; but bright and sunny with a sparkle in the air, which is delightful after four days of unintermitting rain.  In the streets I saw two men meet after a long separation, it was plain.  They came forward with a little run and <hi rend="italic">leaped</hi> at each other’s hands.  You never saw such bright eyes as they both had.  It put one in a good humour to see it.</p>

                     <p rend="justify">8 <hi rend="italic">p.m.</hi>—I made a little more out of my work than I have made for a long while back; though even now I cannot make things fall into sentences—they only sprawl over the paper in bald orphan clauses.  Then I was about in the afternoon with Baxter; and we had a good deal of fun, first rhyming on the names of all the shops we passed, and afterwards buying needles and quack drugs from open-air vendors, and taking much pleasure in their inexhaustible eloquence.  Every now and then as we went, Arthur’s Seat showed its head at the end of a street.  Now, to-day the blue sky and the sunshine were both entirely wintry; and there was about the hill, in these glimpses, a sort of thin, unreal, crystalline distinctness that I have not often seen excelled.  As the sun began to go down over the valley between the new town and the old, the evening grew resplendent; all the gardens and low-lying buildings sank back and became almost invisible in a mist of wonderful sun, and the Castle stood up against the sky, as thin and sharp in outline as a castle cut out of paper.  Baxter made a good remark about Princes Street, that it was the most elastic street for length that he knew; sometimes it looks, as it looked to-night, interminable, a way leading right into the heart of the red sundown; sometimes, again, it shrinks together, as if for warmth, on one of the withering, clear east-windy days, until it seems to lie underneath your feet.</p>

                     <p rend="justify">I shall tell you a story.  Last Friday I went down to Portobello, in the heavy rain, with an uneasy wind blowing <hi rend="italic">par rafales</hi> off the sea (or ‘<hi rend="italic">en rafales</hi>’ should it be? or what?).  As I got down near the beach a poor woman, oldish, and seemingly, lately at least, respectable, followed me and made signs.  She was drenched to the skin, and looked wretched below wretchedness.  You know, I did not like to look back at her; it seemed as if she might misunderstand and be terribly hurt and slighted; so I stood at the end of the street—there was no one else within sight in the wet—and lifted up my hand very high with some money in it.  I heard her steps draw heavily near behind me, and, when she was near enough to see, I let the money fall in the mud and went off at my best walk without ever turning round.  There is nothing in the story; and yet you will understand how much there is, if one chose to set it forth.  You see, she was so ugly; and you know there is something terribly, miserably pathetic in a certain smile, a certain sodden aspect of invitation on such faces.  It is so terrible, that it is in a way sacred; it means the outside of degradation and (what is worst of all in life) false position.  I hope you understand me rightly.—Ever your faithful friend,</p>

                     <p rend="justify">My father has returned in better health, and I am more delighted than I can well tell you.  The one trouble that I can see no way through is that his health, or my mother’s, should give way.  To-night, as I was walking along Princes Street, I heard the bugles sound the recall.  I do not think I had ever remarked it before; there is something of unspeakable appeal in the cadence.  I felt as if something yearningly cried to me out of the darkness overhead to come thither and find rest; one felt as if there must be warm hearts and bright fires waiting for one up there, where the buglers stood on the damp pavement and sounded their friendly invitation forth into the night.</p>

                     <p rend="justify">I am glad to hear what you say about the Exam.; until quite lately I have treated that pretty cavalierly, for I say honestly that I do not mind being plucked; I shall just have to go up again.  We travelled with the Lord Advocate the other day, and he strongly advised me in my father’s hearing to go to the English Bar; and the Lord Advocate’s advice goes a long way in Scotland.  It is a sort of special legal revelation.  Don’t misunderstand me.  I don’t, of course, want to be plucked; but so far as my style of knowledge suits them, I cannot make much betterment on it in a month.  If they wish scholarship more exact, I must take a new lease altogether.</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR MOTHER,—The <hi rend="italic">Place</hi> is not where I thought; it is about where the old Post Office was.  The Hotel de Londres is no more an hotel.  I have found a charming room in the Hotel du Pavillon, just across the road from the Prince’s Villa; it has one window to the south and one to the east, with a superb view of Mentone and the hills, to which I move this afternoon.  In the old great <hi rend="italic">Place</hi> there is a kiosque for the sale of newspapers; a string of omnibuses (perhaps thirty) go up and down under the plane-trees of the Turin Road on the occasion of each train; the Promenade has crossed both streams, and bids fair to reach the Cap St. Martin.  The old chapel near Freeman’s house at the entrance to the Gorbio valley is now entirely submerged under a shining new villa, with Pavilion annexed; over which, in all the pride of oak and chestnut and divers coloured marbles, I was shown this morning by the obliging proprietor.  The Prince’s Palace itself is rehabilitated, and shines afar with white window-curtains from the midst of a garden, all trim borders and greenhouses and carefully kept walks.  On the other side, the villas are more thronged together, and they have arranged themselves, shelf after shelf, behind each other.  I see the glimmer of new buildings, too, as far eastward as Grimaldi; and a viaduct carries (I suppose) the railway past the mouth of the bone caves.  F. Bacon (Lord Chancellor) made the remark that ‘Time was the greatest innovator’; it is perhaps as meaningless a remark as was ever made; but as Bacon made it, I suppose it is better than any that I could make.  Does it not seem as if things were fluid?  They are displaced and altered in ten years so that one has difficulty, even with a memory so very vivid and retentive for that sort of thing as mine, in identifying places where one lived a long while in the past, and which one has kept piously in mind during all the interval.  Nevertheless, the hills, I am glad to say, are unaltered; though I dare say the torrents have given them many a shrewd scar, and the rains and thaws dislodged many a boulder from their heights, if one were only keen enough to perceive it.  The sea makes the same noise in the shingle; and the lemon and orange gardens still discharge in the still air their fresh perfume; and the people have still brown comely faces; and the Pharmacie Gros still dispenses English medicines; and the invalids (eheu!) still sit on the promenade and trifle with their fingers in the fringes of shawls and wrappers; and the shop of Pascal Amarante still, in its present bright consummate flower of aggrandisement and new paint, offers everything that it has entered into people’s hearts to wish for in the idleness of a sanatorium; and the ‘Château des Morts’ is still at the top of the town; and the fort and the jetty are still at the foot, only there are now two jetties; and—I am out of breath.  (To be continued in our next.)</p>
                     <p rend="justify">For myself, I have come famously through the journey; and as I have written this letter (for the first time for ever so long) with ease and even pleasure, I think my head must be better.  I am still no good at coming down hills or stairs; and my feet are more consistently cold than is quite comfortable.  But, these apart, I feel well; and in good spirits all round.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I have written to Nice for letters, and hope to get them to-night.  Continue to address Poste Restante.  Take care of yourselves.</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR FRIEND,—I sat a long while up among the olive yards to-day at a favourite corner, where one has a fair view down the valley and on to the blue floor of the sea.  I had a Horace with me, and read a little; but Horace, when you try to read him fairly under the open heaven, sounds urban, and you find something of the escaped townsman in his descriptions of the country, just as somebody said that Morris’s sea-pieces were all taken from the coast.  I tried for long to hit upon some language that might catch ever so faintly the indefinable shifting colour of olive leaves; and, above all, the changes and little silverings that pass over them, like blushes over a face, when the wind tosses great branches to and fro; but the Muse was not favourable.  A few birds scattered here and there at wide intervals on either side of the valley sang the little broken songs of late autumn and there was a great stir of insect life in the grass at my feet.  The path up to this coign of vantage, where I think I shall make it a habit to ensconce myself a while of a morning, is for a little while common to the peasant and a little clear brooklet.  It is pleasant, in the tempered grey daylight of the olive shadows, to see the people picking their way among the stones and the water and the brambles; the women especially, with the weights poised on their heads and walking all from the hips with a certain graceful deliberation.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">
                        <hi rend="italic">Tuesday</hi>.—I have been to Nice to-day to see Dr. Bennet; he agrees with Clark that there is no disease; but I finished up my day with a lamentable exhibition of weakness.  I could not remember French, or at least I was afraid to go into any place lest I should not be able to remember it, and so could not tell when the train went.  At last I crawled up to the station and sat down on the steps, and just steeped myself there in the sunshine until the evening began to fall and the air to grow chilly.  This long rest put me all right; and I came home here triumphantly and ate dinner well.  There is the full, true, and particular account of the worst day I have had since I left London.  I shall not go to Nice again for some time to come.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">
                        <hi rend="italic">Thursday</hi>.—I am to-day quite recovered, and got into Mentone to-day for a book, which is quite a creditable walk.  As an intellectual being I have not yet begun to re-exist; my immortal soul is still very nearly extinct; but we must hope the best.  Now, do take warning by me.  I am set up by a beneficent providence at the corner of the road, to warn you to flee from the hebetude that is to follow.  Being sent to the South is not much good unless you take your soul with you, you see; and my soul is rarely with me here.  I don’t see much beauty.  I have lost the key; I can only be placid and inert, and see the bright days go past uselessly one after another; therefore don’t talk foolishly with your mouth any more about getting liberty by being ill and going south <hi rend="italic">viâ</hi> the sickbed.  It is not the old free-born bird that gets thus to freedom; but I know not what manacled and hide-bound spirit, incapable of pleasure, the clay of a man.  Go south!  Why, I saw more beauty with my eyes healthfully alert to see in two wet windy February afternoons in Scotland than I can see in my beautiful olive gardens and grey hills in a whole week in my low and lost estate, as the Shorter Catechism puts it somewhere.  It is a pitiable blindness, this blindness of the soul; I hope it may not be long with me.  So remember to keep well; and remember rather anything than not to keep well; and again I say, <hi rend="italic">anything</hi> rather than not to keep well.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Not that I am unhappy, mind you.  I have found the words already—placid and inert, that is what I am.  I sit in the sun and enjoy the tingle all over me, and I am cheerfully ready to concur with any one who says that this is a beautiful place, and I have a sneaking partiality for the newspapers, which would be all very well, if one had not fallen from heaven and were not troubled with some reminiscence of the <hi rend="italic">ineffable aurore</hi>.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">To sit by the sea and to be conscious of nothing but the sound of the waves, and the sunshine over all your body, is not unpleasant; but I was an Archangel once.</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR MOTHER,—We have here fallen on the very pink of hotels.  I do not say that it is more pleasantly conducted than the Pavillon, for that were impossible; but the rooms are so cheery and bright and new, and then the food!  I never, I think, so fully appreciated the phrase ‘the fat of the land’ as I have done since I have been here installed.  There was a dish of eggs at <hi rend="italic">déjeûner</hi> the other day, over the memory of which I lick my lips in the silent watches.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Now that the cold has gone again, I continue to keep well in body, and already I begin to walk a little more.  My head is still a very feeble implement, and easily set a-spinning; and I can do nothing in the way of work beyond reading books that may, I hope, be of some use to me afterwards.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I was very glad to see that M‘Laren was sat upon, and principally for the reason why.  Deploring as I do much of the action of the Trades Unions, these conspiracy clauses and the whole partiality of the Master and Servant Act are a disgrace to our equal laws.  Equal laws become a byeword when what is legal for one class becomes a criminal offence for another.  It did my heart good to hear that man tell M‘Laren how, as he had talked much of getting the franchise for working men, he must now be content to see them use it now they had got it.  This is a smooth stone well planted in the foreheads of certain dilettanti radicals, after M‘Laren’s fashion, who are willing to give the working men words and wind, and votes and the like, and yet think to keep all the advantages, just or unjust, of the wealthier classes without abatement.  I do hope wise men will not attempt to fight the working men on the head of this notorious injustice.  Any such step will only precipitate the action of the newly enfranchised classes, and irritate them into acting hastily; when what we ought to desire should be that they should act warily and little for many years to come, until education and habit may make them the more fit.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">All this (intended for my father) is much after the fashion of his own correspondence.  I confess it has left my own head exhausted; I hope it may not produce the same effect on yours.  But I want him to look really into this question (both sides of it, and not the representations of rabid middle-class newspapers, sworn to support all the little tyrannies of wealth), and I know he will be convinced that this is a case of unjust law; and that, however desirable the end may seem to him, he will not be Jesuit enough to think that any end will justify an unjust law.</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR MOTHER,—I received yesterday two most charming letters—the nicest I have had since I left—December 26th and January 1st: this morning I got January 3rd.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Into the bargain with Marie, the American girl, who is grace itself, and comes leaping and dancing simply like a wave—like nothing else, and who yesterday was Queen out of the Epiphany cake and chose Robinet (the French Painter) as her <hi rend="italic">favori</hi> with the most pretty confusion possible—into the bargain with Marie, we have two little Russian girls, with the youngest of whom, a little polyglot button of a three-year old, I had the most laughable little scene at lunch to-day.  I was watching her being fed with great amusement, her face being as broad as it is long, and her mouth capable of unlimited extension; when suddenly, her eye catching mine, the fashion of her countenance was changed, and regarding me with a really admirable appearance of offended dignity, she said something in Italian which made everybody laugh much.  It was explained to me that she had said I was very <hi rend="italic">polisson</hi> to stare at her.  After this she was somewhat taken up with me, and after some examination she announced emphatically to the whole table, in German, that I was a <hi rend="italic">Mädchen</hi>; which word she repeated with shrill emphasis, as though fearing that her proposition would be called in question—<hi rend="italic">Mädchen</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Mädchen</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Mädchen</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Mädchen</hi>.  This hasty conclusion as to my sex she was led afterwards to revise, I am informed; but her new opinion (which seems to have been something nearer the truth) was announced in a third language quite unknown to me, and probably Russian.  To complete the scroll of her accomplishments, she was brought round the table after the meal was over, and said good-bye to me in very commendable English.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">The weather I shall say nothing about, as I am incapable of explaining my sentiments upon that subject before a lady.  But my health is really greatly improved: I begin to recognise myself occasionally now and again, not without satisfaction.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Please remember me very kindly to Professor Swan; I wish I had a story to send him; but story, Lord bless you, I have none to tell, sir, unless it is the foregoing adventure with the little polyglot.  The best of that depends on the significance of <hi rend="italic">polisson</hi>, which is beautifully out of place.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">January</hi>.—The little Russian kid is only two and a half: she speaks six languages.  She and her sister (æt. 8) and May Johnstone (æt. 8) are the delight of my life.  Last night I saw them all dancing—O it was jolly; kids are what is the matter with me.  After the dancing, we all—that is the two Russian ladies, Robinet the French painter, Mr. and Mrs. Johnstone, two governesses, and fitful kids joining us at intervals—played a game of the stool of repentance in the Gallic idiom.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">O—I have not told you that Colvin is gone; however, he is coming back again; he has left clothes in pawn to me.—Ever your affectionate son,</p>

                     <p rend="justify">. . . I lost a Philipine to little Mary Johnstone last night; so to-day I sent her a rubbishing doll’s toilet, and a little note with it, with some verses telling how happy children made every one near them happy also, and advising her to keep the lines, and some day, when she was ‘grown a stately demoiselle,’ it would make her ‘glad to know she gave pleasure long ago,’ all in a very lame fashion, with just a note of prose at the end, telling her to mind her doll and the dog, and not trouble her little head just now to understand the bad verses; for some time when she was ill, as I am now, they would be plain to her and make her happy.  She has just been here to thank me, and has left me very happy.  Children are certainly too good to be true.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Yesterday I walked too far, and spent all the afternoon on the outside of my bed; went finally to rest at nine, and slept nearly twelve hours on the stretch.  Bennet (the doctor), when told of it this morning, augured well for my recovery; he said youth must be putting in strong; of course I ought not to have slept at all.  As it was, I dreamed <hi rend="italic">horridly</hi>; but not my usual dreams of social miseries and misunderstandings and all sorts of crucifixions of the spirit; but of good, cheery, physical things—of long successions of vaulted, dimly lit cellars full of black water, in which I went swimming among toads and unutterable, cold, blind fishes.  Now and then these cellars opened up into sort of domed music-hall places, where one could land for a little on the slope of the orchestra, but a sort of horror prevented one from staying long, and made one plunge back again into the dead waters.  Then my dream changed, and I was a sort of Siamese pirate, on a very high deck with several others.  The ship was almost captured, and we were fighting desperately.  The hideous engines we used and the perfectly incredible carnage that we effected by means of them kept me cheery, as you may imagine; especially as I felt all the time my sympathy with the boarders, and knew that I was only a prisoner with these horrid Malays.  Then I saw a signal being given, and knew they were going to blow up the ship.  I leaped right off, and heard my captors splash in the water after me as thick as pebbles when a bit of river bank has given way beneath the foot.  I never heard the ship blow up; but I spent the rest of the night swimming about some piles with the whole sea full of Malays, searching for me with knives in their mouths.  They could swim any distance under water, and every now and again, just as I was beginning to reckon myself safe, a cold hand would be laid on my ankle—ugh!</p>
                     <p rend="justify">However, my long sleep, troubled as it was, put me all right again, and I was able to work acceptably this morning and be very jolly all day.  This evening I have had a great deal of talk with both the Russian ladies; they talked very nicely, and are bright, likable women both.  They come from Georgia.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">Wednesday</hi>, 10.30.—We have all been to tea to-night at the Russians’ villa.  Tea was made out of a samovar, which is something like a small steam engine, and whose principal advantage is that it burns the fingers of all who lay their profane touch upon it.  After tea Madame Z. played Russian airs, very plaintive and pretty; so the evening was Muscovite from beginning to end.  Madame G.’s daughter danced a tarantella, which was very pretty.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Whenever Nelitchka cries—and she never cries except from pain—all that one has to do is to start ‘Malbrook s’en va-t-en guerre.’  She cannot resist the attraction; she is drawn through her sobs into the air; and in a moment there is Nelly singing, with the glad look that comes into her face always when she sings, and all the tears and pain forgotten.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">It is wonderful, before I shut this up, how that child remains ever interesting to me.  Nothing can stale her infinite variety; and yet it is not very various.  You see her thinking what she is to do or to say next, with a funny grave air of reserve, and then the face breaks up into a smile, and it is probably ‘Berecchino!’ said with that sudden little jump of the voice that one knows in children, as the escape of a jack-in-the-box, and, somehow, I am quite happy after that!</p>

                     <p rend="justify">. . . last night I had a quarrel with the American on politics.  It is odd how it irritates you to hear certain political statements made.  He was excited, and he began suddenly to abuse our conduct to America.  I, of course, admitted right and left that we had behaved disgracefully (as we had); until somehow I got tired of turning alternate cheeks and getting duly buffeted; and when he said that the Alabama money had not wiped out the injury, I suggested, in language (I remember) of admirable directness and force, that it was a pity they had taken the money in that case.  He lost his temper at once, and cried out that his dearest wish was a war with England; whereupon I also lost my temper, and, thundering at the pitch of my voice, I left him and went away by myself to another part of the garden.  A very tender reconciliation took place, and I think there will come no more harm out of it.  We are both of us nervous people, and he had had a very long walk and a good deal of beer at dinner: that explains the scene a little.  But I regret having employed so much of the voice with which I have been endowed, as I fear every person in the hotel was taken into confidence as to my sentiments, just at the very juncture when neither the sentiments nor (perhaps) the language had been sufficiently considered.</p>

                     <p rend="justify">The only new cloud on my horizon (I mean this in no menacing sense) is the Prince.  I have philosophical and artistic discussions with the Prince.  He is capable of talking for two hours upon end, developing his theory of everything under Heaven from his first position, which is that there is no straight line.  Doesn’t that sound like a game of my father’s—I beg your pardon, you haven’t read it—I don’t mean <hi rend="italic">my</hi> father, I mean Tristram Shandy’s.  He is very clever, and it is an immense joke to hear him unrolling all the problems of life—philosophy, science, what you will—in this charmingly cut-and-dry, here-we-are-again kind of manner.  He is better to listen to than to argue withal.  When you differ from him, he lifts up his voice and thunders; and you know that the thunder of an excited foreigner often miscarries.  One stands aghast, marvelling how such a colossus of a man, in such a great commotion of spirit, can open his mouth so much and emit such a still small voice at the hinder end of it all.  All this while he walks about the room, smokes cigarettes, occupies divers chairs for divers brief spaces, and casts his huge arms to the four winds like the sails of a mill.  He is a most sportive Prince.</p>

                     <p rend="justify">We are now at Swanston Cottage, Lothianburn, Edinburgh.  The garden is but little clothed yet, for, you know, here we are six hundred feet above the sea.  It is very cold, and has sleeted this morning.  Everything wintry.  I am very jolly, however, having finished Victor Hugo, and just looking round to see what I should next take up.  I have been reading Roman Law and Calvin this morning.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">Evening</hi>.—I went up the hill a little this afternoon.  The air was invigorating, but it was so cold that my scalp was sore.  With this high wintry wind, and the grey sky, and faint northern daylight, it was quite wonderful to hear such a clamour of blackbirds coming up to me out of the woods, and the bleating of sheep being shorn in a field near the garden, and to see golden patches of blossom already on the furze, and delicate green shoots upright and beginning to frond out, among last year’s russet bracken.  Flights of crows were passing continually between the wintry leaden sky and the wintry cold-looking hills.  It was the oddest conflict of seasons.  A wee rabbit—this year’s making, beyond question—ran out from under my feet, and was in a pretty perturbation, until he hit upon a lucky juniper and blotted himself there promptly.  Evidently this gentleman had not had much experience of life.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I have made an arrangement with my people: I am to have £84 a year—I only asked for £80 on mature reflection—and as I should soon make a good bit by my pen, I shall be very comfortable.  We are all as jolly as can be together, so that is a great thing gained.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">Saturday</hi>.—I have received such a nice long letter (four sides) from Leslie Stephen to-day about my Victor Hugo.  It is accepted.  This ought to have made me gay, but it hasn’t.  I am not likely to be much of a tonic to-night.  I have been very cynical over myself to-day, partly, perhaps, because I have just finished some of the deedest rubbish about Lord Lytton’s fables that an intelligent editor ever shot into his wastepaper basket.  If Morley prints it I shall be glad, but my respect for him will be shaken.</p>

                     <p rend="justify">My father and mother reading.  I think I shall talk to you for a moment or two.  This morning at Swanston, the birds, poor creatures, had the most troubled hour or two; evidently there was a hawk in the neighbourhood; not one sang; and the whole garden thrilled with little notes of warning and terror.  I did not know before that the voice of birds could be so tragically expressive.  I had always heard them before express their trivial satisfaction with the blue sky and the return of daylight.  Really, they almost frightened me; I could hear mothers and wives in terror for those who were dear to them; it was easy to translate, I wish it were as easy to write; but it is very hard in this flying train, or I would write you more.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">Chester</hi>.—I like this place much; but somehow I feel glad when I get among the quiet eighteenth century buildings, in cosy places with some elbow room about them, after the older architecture.  This other is bedevilled and furtive; it seems to stoop; I am afraid of trap-doors, and could not go pleasantly into such houses.  I don’t know how much of this is legitimately the effect of the architecture; little enough possibly; possibly far the most part of it comes from bad historical novels and the disquieting statuary that garnishes some façades.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">On the way, to-day, I passed through my dear Cumberland country.  Nowhere to as great a degree can one find the combination of lowland and highland beauties; the outline of the blue hills is broken by the outline of many tumultuous tree-clumps; and the broad spaces of moorland are balanced by a network of deep hedgerows that might rival Suffolk, in the foreground.—How a railway journey shakes and discomposes one, mind and body!  I grow blacker and blacker in humour as the day goes on; and when at last I am let out, and have the fresh air about me, it is as though I were born again, and the sick fancies flee away from my mind like swans in spring.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I want to come back on what I have said about eighteenth century and middle-age houses: I do not know if I have yet explained to you the sort of loyalty, of urbanity, that there is about the one to my mind; the spirit of a country orderly and prosperous, a flavour of the presence of magistrates and well-to-do merchants in bag-wigs, the clink of glasses at night in fire-lit parlours, something certain and civic and domestic, is all about these quiet, staid, shapely houses, with no character but their exceeding shapeliness, and the comely external utterance that they make of their internal comfort.  Now the others are, as I have said, both furtive and bedevilled; they are sly and grotesque; they combine their sort of feverish grandeur with their sort of secretive baseness, after the manner of a Charles the Ninth.  They are peopled for me with persons of the same fashion.  Dwarfs and sinister people in cloaks are about them; and I seem to divine crypts, and, as I said, trap-doors.  O God be praised that we live in this good daylight and this good peace.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">Barmouth</hi>, <hi rend="italic">August</hi> 9<hi rend="italic">th</hi>.—To-day we saw the cathedral at Chester; and, far more delightful, saw and heard a certain inimitable verger who took us round.  He was full of a certain recondite, far-away humour that did not quite make you laugh at the time, but was somehow laughable to recollect.  Moreover, he had so far a just imagination, and could put one in the right humour for seeing an old place, very much as, according to my favourite text, Scott’s novels and poems do for one.  His account of the monks in the Scriptorium, with their cowls over their heads, in a certain sheltered angle of the cloister where the big Cathedral building kept the sun off the parchments, was all that could be wished; and so too was what he added of the others pacing solemnly behind them and dropping, ever and again, on their knees before a little shrine there is in the wall, ‘to keep ’em in the frame of mind.’  You will begin to think me unduly biassed in this verger’s favour if I go on to tell you his opinion of me.  We got into a little side chapel, whence we could hear the choir children at practice, and I stopped a moment listening to them, with, I dare say, a very bright face, for the sound was delightful to me.  ‘Ah,’ says he, ‘you’re <hi rend="italic">very</hi> fond of music.’  I said I was.  ‘Yes, I could tell that by your head,’ he answered.  ‘There’s a deal in that head.’  And he shook his own solemnly.  I said it might be so, but I found it hard, at least, to get it out.  Then my father cut in brutally, said anyway I had no ear, and left the verger so distressed and shaken in the foundations of his creed that, I hear, he got my father aside afterwards and said he was sure there was something in my face, and wanted to know what it was, if not music.  He was relieved when he heard that I occupied myself with litterature (which word, note here, I do not spell correctly).  Good-night, and here’s the verger’s health!</p>

                     <p rend="justify">I have been hard at work all yesterday, and besides had to write a long letter to Bob, so I found no time until quite late, and then was sleepy.  Last night it blew a fearful gale; I was kept awake about a couple of hours, and could not get to sleep for the horror of the wind’s noise; the whole house shook; and, mind you, our house <hi rend="italic">is</hi> a house, a great castle of jointed stone that would weigh up a street of English houses; so that when it quakes, as it did last night, it means something.  But the quaking was not what put me about; it was the horrible howl of the wind round the corner; the audible haunting of an incarnate anger about the house; the evil spirit that was abroad; and, above all, the shuddering silent pauses when the storm’s heart stands dreadfully still for a moment.  O how I hate a storm at night!  They have been a great influence in my life, I am sure; for I can remember them so far back—long before I was six at least, for we left the house in which I remember listening to them times without number when I was six.  And in those days the storm had for me a perfect impersonation, as durable and unvarying as any heathen deity.  I always heard it, as a horseman riding past with his cloak about his head, and somehow always carried away, and riding past again, and being baffled yet once more, <hi rend="italic">ad infinitum</hi>, all night long.  I think I wanted him to get past, but I am not sure; I know only that I had some interest either for or against in the matter; and I used to lie and hold my breath, not quite frightened, but in a state of miserable exaltation.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">My first John Knox is in proof, and my second is on the anvil.  It is very good of me so to do; for I want so much to get to my real tour and my sham tour, the real tour first: it is always working in my head, and if I can only turn on the right sort of style at the right moment, I am not much afraid of it.  One thing bothers me; what with hammering at this J. K., and writing necessary letters, and taking necessary exercise (that even not enough, the weather is so repulsive to me, cold and windy), I find I have no time for reading except times of fatigue, when I wish merely to relax myself.  O—and I read over again for this purpose Flaubert’s <hi rend="italic">Tentation de St. Antoine</hi>; it struck me a good deal at first, but this second time it has fetched me immensely.  I am but just done with it, so you will know the large proportion of salt to take with my present statement, that it’s the finest thing I ever read!  Of course, it isn’t that, it’s full of <hi rend="italic">longueurs</hi>, and is not quite ‘redd up,’ as we say in Scotland, not quite articulated; but there are splendid things in it.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">Monday</hi>.—I have come from a concert, and the concert was rather a disappointment.  Not so my afternoon skating—Duddingston, our big loch, is bearing; and I wish you could have seen it this afternoon, covered with people, in thin driving snow flurries, the big hill grim and white and alpine overhead in the thick air, and the road up the gorge, as it were into the heart of it, dotted black with traffic.  Moreover, I <hi rend="italic">can</hi> skate a little bit; and what one can do is always pleasant to do.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">
                        <hi rend="italic">Tuesday</hi>.—I got your letter to-day, and was so glad thereof.  It was of good omen to me also.  I worked from ten to one (my classes are suspended now for Xmas holidays), and wrote four or five Portfolio pages of my Buckinghamshire affair.  Then I went to Duddingston and skated all afternoon.  If you had seen the moon rising, a perfect sphere of smoky gold, in the dark air above the trees, and the white loch thick with skaters, and the great hill, snow-sprinkled, overhead!  It was a sight for a king.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">
                        <hi rend="italic">Wednesday</hi>.—I stayed on Duddingston to-day till after nightfall.  The little booths that hucksters set up round the edge were marked each one by its little lamp.  There were some fires too; and the light, and the shadows of the people who stood round them to warm themselves, made a strange pattern all round on the snow-covered ice.  A few people with torches began to travel up and down the ice, a lit circle travelling along with them over the snow.  A gigantic moon rose, meanwhile, over the trees and the kirk on the promontory, among perturbed and vacillating clouds.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">The walk home was very solemn and strange.  Once, through a broken gorge, we had a glimpse of a little space of mackerel sky, moon-litten, on the other side of the hill; the broken ridges standing grey and spectral between; and the hilltop over all, snow-white, and strangely magnified in size.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">This must go to you to-morrow, so that you may read it on Christmas Day for company.  I hope it may be good company to you.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">
                        <hi rend="italic">Thursday</hi>.—Outside, it snows thick and steadily.  The gardens before our house are now a wonderful fairy forest.  And O, this whiteness of things, how I love it, how it sends the blood about my body!  Maurice de Guérin hated snow; what a fool he must have been!  Somebody tried to put me out of conceit with it by saying that people were lost in it.  As if people don’t get lost in love, too, and die of devotion to art; as if everything worth were not an occasion to some people’s end.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">What a wintry letter this is!  Only I think it is winter seen from the inside of a warm greatcoat.  And there is, at least, a warm heart about it somewhere.  Do you know, what they say in Xmas stories is true?  I think one loves their friends more dearly at this season.—Ever your faithful friend,</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR COLVIN,—I have worked too hard; I have given myself one day of rest, and that was not enough; so I am giving myself another.  I shall go to bed again likewise so soon as this is done, and slumber most potently.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">9 P.M., slept all afternoon like a lamb.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">About my coming south, I think the still small unanswerable voice of coins will make it impossible until the session is over (end of March); but for all that, I think I shall hold out jolly.  I do not want you to come and bother yourself; indeed, it is still not quite certain whether my father will be quite fit for you, although I have now no fear of that really.  Now don’t take up this wrongly; I wish you could come; and I do not know anything that would make me happier, but I see that it is wrong to expect it, and so I resign myself: some time after.  I offered Appleton a series of papers on the modern French school—the Parnassiens, I think they call them—de Banville, Coppée, Soulary, and Sully Prudhomme.  But he has not deigned to answer my letter.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I shall have another Portfolio paper so soon as I am done with this story, that has played me out; the story is to be called <hi rend="italic">When the Devil was well</hi>: scene, Italy, Renaissance; colour, purely imaginary of course, my own unregenerate idea of what Italy then was.  O, when shall I find the story of my dreams, that shall never halt nor wander nor step aside, but go ever before its face, and ever swifter and louder, until the pit receives it, roaring?  The Portfolio paper will be about Scotland and England.—Ever yours,</p>

                     <p rend="justify">I got your nice long gossiping letter to-day—I mean by that that there was more news in it than usual—and so, of course, I am pretty jolly.  I am in the house, however, with such a beastly cold in the head.  Our east winds begin already to be very cold.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">O, I have such a longing for children of my own; and yet I do not think I could bear it if I had one.  I fancy I must feel more like a woman than like a man about that.  I sometimes hate the children I see on the street—you know what I mean by hate—wish they were somewhere else, and not there to mock me; and sometimes, again, I don’t know how to go by them for the love of them, especially the very wee ones.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">
                        <hi rend="italic">Thursday</hi>.—I have been still in the house since I wrote, and I <hi rend="italic">have</hi> worked.  I finished the Italian story; not well, but as well as I can just now; I must go all over it again, some time soon, when I feel in the humour to better and perfect it.  And now I have taken up an old story, begun years ago; and I have now re-written all I had written of it then, and mean to finish it.  What I have lost and gained is odd.  As far as regards simple writing, of course, I am in another world now; but in some things, though more clumsy, I seem to have been freer and more plucky: this is a lesson I have taken to heart.  I have got a jolly new name for my old story.  I am going to call it <hi rend="italic">A Country Dance</hi>; the two heroes keep changing places, you know; and the chapter where the most of this changing goes on is to be called ‘Up the middle, down the middle.’  It will be in six, or (perhaps) seven chapters.  I have never worked harder in my life than these last four days.  If I can only keep it up.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">Saturday</hi>.—Yesterday, Leslie Stephen, who was down here to lecture, called on me and took me up to see a poor fellow, a poet who writes for him, and who has been eighteen months in our infirmary, and may be, for all I know, eighteen months more.  It was very sad to see him there, in a little room with two beds, and a couple of sick children in the other bed; a girl came in to visit the children, and played dominoes on the counterpane with them; the gas flared and crackled, the fire burned in a dull economical way; Stephen and I sat on a couple of chairs, and the poor fellow sat up in his bed with his hair and beard all tangled, and talked as cheerfully as if he had been in a King’s palace, or the great King’s palace of the blue air.  He has taught himself two languages since he has been lying there.  I shall try to be of use to him.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">We have had two beautiful spring days, mild as milk, windy withal, and the sun hot.  I dreamed last night I was walking by moonlight round the place where the scene of my story is laid; it was all so quiet and sweet, and the blackbirds were singing as if it was day; it made my heart very cool and happy.—Ever yours,</p>

                     <p rend="justify">Here is my long story: yesterday night, after having supped, I grew so restless that I was obliged to go out in search of some excitement.  There was a half-moon lying over on its back, and incredibly bright in the midst of a faint grey sky set with faint stars: a very inartistic moon, that would have damned a picture.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">At the most populous place of the city I found a little boy, three years old perhaps, half frantic with terror, and crying to every one for his ‘Mammy.’  This was about eleven, mark you.  People stopped and spoke to him, and then went on, leaving him more frightened than before.  But I and a good-humoured mechanic came up together; and I instantly developed a latent faculty for setting the hearts of children at rest.  Master Tommy Murphy (such was his name) soon stopped crying, and allowed me to take him up and carry him; and the mechanic and I trudged away along Princes Street to find his parents.  I was soon so tired that I had to ask the mechanic to carry the bairn; and you should have seen the puzzled contempt with which he looked at me, for knocking in so soon.  He was a good fellow, however, although very impracticable and sentimental; and he soon bethought him that Master Murphy might catch cold after his excitement, so we wrapped him up in my greatcoat.  ‘Tobauga (Tobago) Street’ was the address he gave us; and we deposited him in a little grocer’s shop and went through all the houses in the street without being able to find any one of the name of Murphy.  Then I set off to the head police office, leaving my greatcoat in pawn about Master Murphy’s person.  As I went down one of the lowest streets in the town, I saw a little bit of life that struck me.  It was now half-past twelve, a little shop stood still half-open, and a boy of four or five years old was walking up and down before it imitating cockcrow.  He was the only living creature within sight.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">At the police offices no word of Master Murphy’s parents; so I went back empty-handed.  The good groceress, who had kept her shop open all this time, could keep the child no longer; her father, bad with bronchitis, said he must forth.  So I got a large scone with currants in it, wrapped my coat about Tommy, got him up on my arm, and away to the police office with him: not very easy in my mind, for the poor child, young as he was—he could scarce speak—was full of terror for the ‘office,’ as he called it.  He was now very grave and quiet and communicative with me; told me how his father thrashed him, and divers household matters.  Whenever he saw a woman on our way he looked after her over my shoulder and then gave his judgment: ‘That’s no <hi rend="italic">her</hi>,’ adding sometimes, ‘She has a wean wi’ her.’  Meantime I was telling him how I was going to take him to a gentleman who would find out his mother for him quicker than ever I could, and how he must not be afraid of him, but be brave, as he had been with me.  We had just arrived at our destination—we were just under the lamp—when he looked me in the face and said appealingly, ‘He’ll no put—me in the office?’  And I had to assure him that he would not, even as I pushed open the door and took him in.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">The serjeant was very nice, and I got Tommy comfortably seated on a bench, and spirited him up with good words and the scone with the currants in it; and then, telling him I was just going out to look for Mammy, I got my greatcoat and slipped away.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Poor little boy! he was not called for, I learn, until ten this morning.  This is very ill written, and I’ve missed half that was picturesque in it; but to say truth, I am very tired and sleepy: it was two before I got to bed.  However, you see, I had my excitement.</p>
                     <p rend="justify"> </p>
                     <p rend="justify">
                        <hi rend="italic">Monday</hi>.—I have written nothing all morning; I cannot settle to it.  Yes—I <hi rend="italic">will</hi> though.</p>
                     <p rend="justify"> </p>
                     <p rend="justify">10.45.—And I did.  I want to say something more to you about the three women.  I wonder so much why they should have been <hi rend="italic">women</hi>, and halt between two opinions in the matter.  Sometimes I think it is because they were made by a man for men; sometimes, again, I think there is an abstract reason for it, and there is something more substantive about a woman than ever there can be about a man.  I can conceive a great mythical woman, living alone among inaccessible mountain-tops or in some lost island in the pagan seas, and ask no more.  Whereas if I hear of a Hercules, I ask after Iole or Dejanira.  I cannot think him a man without women.  But I can think of these three deep-breasted women, living out all their days on remote hilltops, seeing the white dawn and the purple even, and the world outspread before them for ever, and no more to them for ever than a sight of the eyes, a hearing of the ears, a far-away interest of the inflexible heart, not pausing, not pitying, but austere with a holy austerity, rigid with a calm and passionless rigidity; and I find them none the less women to the end.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">And think, if one could love a woman like that once, see her once grow pale with passion, and once wring your lips out upon hers, would it not be a small thing to die?  Not that there is not a passion of a quite other sort, much less epic, far more dramatic and intimate, that comes out of the very frailty of perishable women; out of the lines of suffering that we see written about their eyes, and that we may wipe out if it were but for a moment; out of the thin hands, wrought and tempered in agony to a fineness of perception, that the indifferent or the merely happy cannot know; out of the tragedy that lies about such a love, and the pathetic incompleteness.  This is another thing, and perhaps it is a higher.  I look over my shoulder at the three great headless Madonnas, and they look back at me and do not move; see me, and through and over me, the foul life of the city dying to its embers already as the night draws on; and over miles and miles of silent country, set here and there with lit towns, thundered through here and there with night expresses scattering fire and smoke; and away to the ends of the earth, and the furthest star, and the blank regions of nothing; and they are not moved.  My quiet, great-kneed, deep-breasted, well-draped ladies of Necessity, I give my heart to you!</p>

                     <p rend="justify">Yesterday Bob and I walked home; it came on a very creditable thunderstorm; we were soon wet through; sometimes the rain was so heavy that one could only see by holding the hand over the eyes; and to crown all, we lost our way and wandered all over the place, and into the artillery range, among broken trees, with big shot lying about among the rocks.  It was near dinner-time when we got to Barbizon; and it is supposed that we walked from twenty-three to twenty-five miles, which is not bad for the Advocate, who is not tired this morning.  I was very glad to be back again in this dear place, and smell the wet forest in the morning.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh</hi>, [<hi rend="italic">Autumn</hi>] 1875.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR COLVIN,—Thanks for your letter and news.  No—my <hi rend="italic">Burns</hi> is not done yet, it has led me so far afield that I cannot finish it; every time I think I see my way to an end, some new game (or perhaps wild goose) starts up, and away I go.  And then, again, to be plain, I shirk the work of the critical part, shirk it as a man shirks a long jump.  It is awful to have to express and differentiate <hi rend="italic">Burns</hi> in a column or two.  O golly, I say, you know, it <hi rend="italic">can’t</hi> be done at the money.  All the more as I’m going to write a book about it.  <hi rend="italic">Ramsay</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Fergusson</hi>, <hi rend="italic">and Burns</hi>: <hi rend="italic">an Essay</hi> (or <hi rend="italic">a critical essay</hi>? but then I’m going to give lives of the three gentlemen, only the gist of the book is the criticism) <hi rend="italic">by Robert Louis Stevenson</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Advocate</hi>.  How’s that for cut and dry?  And I <hi rend="italic">could</hi> write this book.  Unless I deceive myself, I could even write it pretty adequately.  I feel as if I was really in it, and knew the game thoroughly.  You see what comes of trying to write an essay on <hi rend="italic">Burns</hi> in ten columns.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Meantime, when I have done Burns, I shall finish Charles of Orleans (who is in a good way, about the fifth month, I should think, and promises to be a fine healthy child, better than any of his elder brothers for a while); and then perhaps a Villon, for Villon is a very essential part of my <hi rend="italic">Ramsay-Fergusson-Burns</hi>; I mean, is a note in it, and will recur again and again for comparison and illustration; then, perhaps, I may try Fontainebleau, by the way.  But so soon as Charles of Orleans is polished off, and immortalised for ever, he and his pipings, in a solid imperishable shrine of R. L. S., my true aim and end will be this little book.  Suppose I could jerk you out 100 Cornhill pages; that would easy make 200 pages of decent form; and then thickish paper—eh? would that do?  I dare say it could be made bigger; but I know what 100 pages of copy, bright consummate copy, imply behind the scenes of weary manuscribing; I think if I put another nothing to it, I should not be outside the mark; and 100 Cornhill pages of 500 words means, I fancy (but I never was good at figures), means 500,00 words.  There’s a prospect for an idle young gentleman who lives at home at ease!  The future is thick with inky fingers.  And then perhaps nobody would publish.  <hi rend="italic">Ah nom de dieu</hi>!  What do you think of all this? will it paddle, think you?</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I hope this pen will write; it is the third I have tried.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">About coming up, no, that’s impossible; for I am worse than a bankrupt.  I have at the present six shillings and a penny; I have a sounding lot of bills for Christmas; new dress suit, for instance, the old one having gone for Parliament House; and new white shirts to live up to my new profession; I’m as gay and swell and gummy as can be; only all my boots leak; one pair water, and the other two simple black mud; so that my rig is more for the eye, than a very solid comfort to myself.  That is my budget.  Dismal enough, and no prospect of any coin coming in; at least for months.  So that here I am, I almost fear, for the winter; certainly till after Christmas, and then it depends on how my bills ‘turn out’ whether it shall not be till spring.  So, meantime, I must whistle in my cage.  My cage is better by one thing; I am an Advocate now.  If you ask me why that makes it better, I would remind you that in the most distressing circumstances a little consequence goes a long way, and even bereaved relatives stand on precedence round the coffin.  I idle finely.  I read Boswell’s <hi rend="italic">Life of Johnson</hi>, Martin’s <hi rend="italic">History of France</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Allan Ramsay</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Olivier Bosselin</hi>, all sorts of rubbish, <hi rend="italic">àpropos</hi> of <hi rend="italic">Burns</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Commines</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Juvénal des Ursins</hi>, etc.  I walk about the Parliament House five forenoons a week, in wig and gown; I have either a five or six mile walk, or an hour or two hard skating on the rink, every afternoon, without fail.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I have not written much; but, like the seaman’s parrot in the tale, I have thought a deal.  You have never, by the way, returned me either <hi rend="italic">Spring</hi> or <hi rend="italic">Béranger</hi>, which is certainly a d-d shame.  I always comforted myself with that when my conscience pricked me about a letter to you.  ‘Thus conscience’—O no, that’s not appropriate in this connection.—Ever yours,</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR FRIEND,—Since I got your letter I have been able to do a little more work, and I have been much better contented with myself; but I can’t get away, that is absolutely prevented by the state of my purse and my debts, which, I may say, are red like crimson.  I don’t know how I am to clear my hands of them, nor when, not before Christmas anyway.  Yesterday I was twenty-five; so please wish me many happy returns—directly.  This one was not <hi rend="italic">un</hi>happy anyway.  I have got back a good deal into my old random, little-thought way of life, and do not care whether I read, write, speak, or walk, so long as I do something.  I have a great delight in this wheel-skating; I have made great advance in it of late, can do a good many amusing things (I mean amusing in <hi rend="italic">my</hi> sense—amusing to do).  You know, I lose all my forenoons at Court!  So it is, but the time passes; it is a great pleasure to sit and hear cases argued or advised.  This is quite autobiographical, but I feel as if it was some time since we met, and I can tell you, I am glad to meet you again.  In every way, you see, but that of work the world goes well with me.  My health is better than ever it was before; I get on without any jar, nay, as if there never had been a jar, with my parents.  If it weren’t about that work, I’d be happy.  But the fact is, I don’t think—the fact is, I’m going to trust in Providence about work.  If I could get one or two pieces I hate out of my way all would be well, I think; but these obstacles disgust me, and as I know I ought to do them first, I don’t do anything.  I must finish this off, or I’ll just lose another day.  I’ll try to write again soon.—Ever your faithful friend,</p>

                     <p rend="justify">My soul was full of disgust ere I got back.  And yet the ships were beautiful to see, as they are always; and on the pier there was a clean cold wind that smelt a little of the sea, though it came down the Firth, and the sunset had a certain <hi rend="italic">éclat</hi> and warmth.  Perhaps if I could get more work done, I should be in a better trim to enjoy filthy streets and people and cold grim weather; but I don’t much feel as if it was what I would have chosen.  I am tempted every day of my life to go off on another walking tour.  I like that better than anything else that I know.—Ever your faithful friend,</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR HENLEY,—Here I am, you see; and if you will take to a map, you will observe I am already more than two doors from Antwerp, whence I started.  I have fought it through under the worst weather I ever saw in France; I have been wet through nearly every day of travel since the second (inclusive); besides this, I have had to fight against pretty mouldy health; so that, on the whole, the essayist and reviewer has shown, I think, some pluck.  Four days ago I was not a hundred miles from being miserably drowned, to the immense regret of a large circle of friends and the permanent impoverishment of British Essayism and Reviewery.  My boat culbutted me under a fallen tree in a very rapid current; and I was a good while before I got on to the outside of that fallen tree; rather a better while than I cared about.  When I got up, I lay some time on my belly, panting, and exuded fluid.  All my symptoms <hi rend="italic">jusqu’ ici</hi> are trifling.  But I’ve a damned sore throat.—Yours ever,</p>

                     <p rend="justify">. . . A perfect chorus of repudiation is sounding in my ears; and although you say nothing, I know you must be repudiating me, all the same.  Write I cannot—there’s no good mincing matters, a letter frightens me worse than the devil; and I am just as unfit for correspondence as if I had never learned the three R.’s.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Let me give my news quickly before I relapse into my usual idleness.  I have a terror lest I should relapse before I get this finished.  Courage, R. L. S.!  On Leslie Stephen’s advice, I gave up the idea of a book of essays.  He said he didn’t imagine I was rich enough for such an amusement; and moreover, whatever was worth publication was worth republication.  So the best of those I had ready: ‘An Apology for Idlers’ is in proof for the <hi rend="italic">Cornhill</hi>.  I have ‘Villon’ to do for the same magazine, but God knows when I’ll get it done, for drums, trumpets—I’m engaged upon—trumpets, drums—a novel!  ‘The Hair Trunk; or, the Ideal Commonwealth.’  It is a most absurd story of a lot of young Cambridge fellows who are going to found a new society, with no ideas on the subject, and nothing but Bohemian tastes in the place of ideas; and who are—well, I can’t explain about the trunk—it would take too long—but the trunk is the fun of it—everybody steals it; burglary, marine fight, life on desert island on west coast of Scotland, sloops, etc.  The first scene where they make their grand schemes and get drunk is supposed to be very funny, by Henley.  I really saw him laugh over it until he cried.</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR COLVIN,—I’m to be whipped away to-morrow to Penzance, where at the post-office a letter will find me glad and grateful.  I am well, but somewhat tired out with overwork.  I have only been home a fortnight this morning, and I have already written to the tune of forty-five <hi rend="italic">Cornhill</hi> pages and upwards.  The most of it was only very laborious re-casting and re-modelling, it is true; but it took it out of me famously, all the same.</p>

                     <p rend="justify">My ‘Villon’ is out this month; I should so much like to know what you think of it.  Stephen has written to me apropos of ‘Idlers,’ that something more in that vein would be agreeable to his views.  From Stephen I count that a devil of a lot.</p>

You will do well to stick to your burn, that is a delightful life you sketch, and a very fountain of health.  I wish I could live like that but, alas! it is just as well I got my ‘Idlers’ written and done with, for I have quite lost all power of resting.  I have a goad in my flesh continually, pushing me to work, work, work.  I have an essay pretty well through for Stephen; a story, ‘The Sire de Malétroit’s Mousetrap,’ with which I shall try <hi rend="italic">Temple Bar</hi>; another story, in the clouds, ‘The Stepfather’s Story,’ most pathetic work of a high morality or immorality, according to point of view; and lastly, also in the clouds, or perhaps a little farther away, an essay on the ‘Two St. Michael’s Mounts,’ historical and picturesque; perhaps if it didn’t come too long, I might throw in the ‘Bass Rock,’ and call it ‘Three Sea Fortalices,’ or something of that kind.  You see how work keeps bubbling in my mind.  Then I shall do another fifteenth century paper this autumn—La Sale and <hi rend="italic">Petit Jehan de Saintré</hi>, which is a kind of fifteenth century <hi rend="italic">Sandford and Merton</hi>, ending in horrid immoral cynicism, as if the author had got tired of being didactic, and just had a good wallow in the mire to wind up with and indemnify himself for so much restraint.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Cornwall is not much to my taste, being as bleak as the bleakest parts of Scotland, and nothing like so pointed and characteristic.  It has a flavour of its own, though, which I may try and catch, if I find the space, in the proposed article.  ‘Will o’ the Mill’ I sent, red hot, to Stephen in a fit of haste, and have not yet had an answer.  I am quite prepared for a refusal.  But I begin to have more hope in the story line, and that should improve my income anyway.  I am glad you liked ‘Villon’; some of it was not as good as it ought to be, but on the whole it seems pretty vivid, and the features strongly marked.  Vividness and not style is now my line; style is all very well, but vividness is the real line of country; if a thing is meant to be read, it seems just as well to try and make it readable.  I am such a dull person I cannot keep off my own immortal works.  Indeed, they are scarcely ever out of my head.  And yet I value them less and less every day.  But occupation is the great thing; so that a man should have his life in his own pocket, and never be thrown out of work by anything.  I am glad to hear you are better.  I must stop—going to Land’s End.—Always your faithful friend,</p>

                     <p rend="justify">DEAR SIR,—It would not be very easy for me to give you any idea of the pleasure I found in your present.  People who write for the magazines (probably from a guilty conscience) are apt to suppose their works practically unpublished.  It seems unlikely that any one would take the trouble to read a little paper buried among so many others; and reading it, read it with any attention or pleasure.  And so, I can assure you, your little book, coming from so far, gave me all the pleasure and encouragement in the world.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I suppose you know and remember Charles Lamb’s essay on distant correspondents?  Well, I was somewhat of his way of thinking about my mild productions.  I did not indeed imagine they were read, and (I suppose I may say) enjoyed right round upon the other side of the big Football we have the honour to inhabit.  And as your present was the first sign to the contrary, I feel I have been very ungrateful in not writing earlier to acknowledge the receipt.  I dare say, however, you hate writing letters as much as I can do myself (for if you like my article, I may presume other points of sympathy between us); and on this hypothesis you will be ready to forgive me the delay.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I may mention with regard to the piece of verses called ‘Such is Life,’ that I am not the only one on this side of the Football aforesaid to think it a good and bright piece of work, and recognised a link of sympathy with the poets who ‘play in hostelries at euchre.’—Believe me, dear sir, yours truly,</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR SIR,—I am afraid you must already have condemned me for a very idle fellow truly.  Here it is more than two months since I received your letter; I had no fewer than three journals to acknowledge; and never a sign upon my part.  If you have seen a <hi rend="italic">Cornhill</hi> paper of mine upon idling, you will be inclined to set it all down to that.  But you will not be doing me justice.  Indeed, I have had a summer so troubled that I have had little leisure and still less inclination to write letters.  I was keeping the devil at bay with all my disposable activities; and more than once I thought he had me by the throat.  The odd conditions of our acquaintance enable me to say more to you than I would to a person who lived at my elbow.  And besides, I am too much pleased and flattered at our correspondence not to go as far as I can to set myself right in your eyes.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">In this damnable confusion (I beg pardon) I have lost all my possessions, or near about, and quite lost all my wits.  I wish I could lay my hands on the numbers of the <hi rend="italic">Review</hi>, for I know I wished to say something on that head more particularly than I can from memory; but where they have escaped to, only time or chance can show.  However, I can tell you so far, that I was very much pleased with the article on Bret Harte; it seemed to me just, clear, and to the point.  I agreed pretty well with all you said about George Eliot: a high, but, may we not add?—a rather dry lady.  Did you—I forget—did you have a kick at the stern works of that melancholy puppy and humbug Daniel Deronda himself?—the Prince of prigs; the literary abomination of desolation in the way of manhood; a type which is enough to make a man forswear the love of women, if that is how it must be gained. . . . Hats off all the same, you understand: a woman of genius.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Of your poems I have myself a kindness for ‘Noll and Nell,’ although I don’t think you have made it as good as you ought: verse five is surely not <hi rend="italic">quite melodious</hi>.  I confess I like the Sonnet in the last number of the <hi rend="italic">Review</hi>—the Sonnet to England.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Please, if you have not, and I don’t suppose you have, already read it, institute a search in all Melbourne for one of the rarest and certainly one of the best of books—<hi rend="italic">Clarissa Harlowe</hi>.  For any man who takes an interest in the problems of the two sexes, that book is a perfect mine of documents.  And it is written, sir, with the pen of an angel.  Miss Howe and Lovelace, words cannot tell how good they are!  And the scene where Clarissa beards her family, with her fan going all the while; and some of the quarrel scenes between her and Lovelace; and the scene where Colonel Marden goes to Mr. Hall, with Lord M. trying to compose matters, and the Colonel with his eternal ‘finest woman in the world,’ and the inimitable affirmation of Mowbray—nothing, nothing could be better!  You will bless me when you read it for this recommendation; but, indeed, I can do nothing but recommend Clarissa.  I am like that Frenchman of the eighteenth century who discovered Habakkuk, and would give no one peace about that respectable Hebrew.  For my part, I never was able to get over his eminently respectable name; Isaiah is the boy, if you must have a prophet, no less.  About Clarissa, I meditate a choice work: <hi rend="italic">A Dialogue on Man</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Woman</hi>, <hi rend="italic">and</hi> ‘<hi rend="italic">Clarissa Harlowe</hi>.’  It is to be so clever that no array of terms can give you any idea; and very likely that particular array in which I shall finally embody it, less than any other.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Do you know, my dear sir, what I like best in your letter?  The egotism for which you thought necessary to apologise.  I am a rogue at egotism myself; and to be plain, I have rarely or never liked any man who was not.  The first step to discovering the beauties of God’s universe is usually a (perhaps partial) apprehension of such of them as adorn our own characters.  When I see a man who does not think pretty well of himself, I always suspect him of being in the right.  And besides, if he does not like himself, whom he has seen, how is he ever to like one whom he never can see but in dim and artificial presentments?</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I cordially reciprocate your offer of a welcome; it shall be at least a warm one.  Are you not my first, my only, admirer—a dear tie?  Besides, you are a man of sense, and you treat me as one by writing to me as you do, and that gives me pleasure also.  Please continue to let me see your work.  I have one or two things coming out in the <hi rend="italic">Cornhill</hi>: a story called ‘The Sire de Malétroit’s Door’ in <hi rend="italic">Temple Bar</hi>; and a series of articles on Edinburgh in the <hi rend="italic">Portfolio</hi>; but I don’t know if these last fly all the way to Melbourne.—Yours very truly,</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR COLVIN,—I am at the <hi rend="italic">Inland Voyage</hi> again: have finished another section, and have only two more to execute.  But one at least of these will be very long—the longest in the book—being a great digression on French artistic tramps.  I only hope Paul may take the thing; I want coin so badly, and besides it would be something done—something put outside of me and off my conscience; and I should not feel such a muff as I do, if once I saw the thing in boards with a ticket on its back.  I think I shall frequent circulating libraries a good deal.  The Preface shall stand over, as you suggest, until the last, and then, sir, we shall see.  This to be read with a big voice.</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR COLVIN,—Many thanks for your letter.  I was much interested by all the Edinburgh gossip.  Most likely I shall arrive in London next week.  I think you know all about the Crane sketch; but it should be a river, not a canal, you know, and the look should be ‘cruel, lewd, and kindly,’ all at once.  There is more sense in that Greek myth of Pan than in any other that I recollect except the luminous Hebrew one of the Fall: one of the biggest things done.  If people would remember that all religions are no more than representations of life, they would find them, as they are, the best representations, licking Shakespeare.</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR GOSSE,—Herewith of the dibbs—a homely fiver.  How, and why, do you continue to exist?  I do so ill, but for a variety of reasons.  First, I wait an angel to come down and trouble the waters; second, more angels; third—well, more angels.  The waters are sluggish; the angels—well, the angels won’t come, that’s about all.  But I sit waiting and waiting, and people bring me meals, which help to pass time (I’m sure it’s very kind of them), and sometimes I whistle to myself; and as there’s a very pretty echo at my pool of Siloam, the thing’s agreeable to hear.  The sun continues to rise every day, to my growing wonder.  ‘The moon by night thee shall not smite.’  And the stars are all doing as well as can be expected.  The air of Arcady is very brisk and pure, and we command many enchanting prospects in space and time.  I do not yet know much about my situation; for, to tell the truth, I only came here by the run since I began to write this letter; I had to go back to date it; and I am grateful to you for having been the occasion of this little outing.  What good travellers we are, if we had only faith; no man need stay in Edinburgh but by unbelief; my religious organ has been ailing for a while past, and I have lain a great deal in Edinburgh, a sheer hulk in consequence.  But I got out my wings, and have taken a change of air.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I read your book with great interest, and ought long ago to have told you so.  An ordinary man would say that he had been waiting till he could pay his debts. . . . The book is good reading.  Your personal notes of those you saw struck me as perhaps most sharp and ‘best held.’  See as many people as you can, and make a book of them before you die.  That will be a living book, upon my word.  You have the touch required.  I ask you to put hands to it in private already.  Think of what Carlyle’s caricature of old Coleridge is to us who never saw S. T. C.  With that and Kubla Khan, we have the man in the fact.  Carlyle’s picture, of course, is not of the author of <hi rend="italic">Kubla</hi>, but of the author of that surprising <hi rend="italic">Friend</hi> which has knocked the breath out of two generations of hopeful youth.  Your portraits would be milder, sweeter, more true perhaps, and perhaps not so truth-<hi rend="italic">telling</hi>—if you will take my meaning.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I have to thank you for an introduction to that beautiful—no, that’s not the word—that jolly, with an Arcadian jollity—thing of Vogelweide’s.  Also for your preface.  Some day I want to read a whole book in the same picked dialect as that preface.  I think it must be one E. W. Gosse who must write it.  He has got himself into a fix with me by writing the preface; I look for a great deal, and will not be easily pleased.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I never thought of it, but my new book, which should soon be out, contains a visit to a murder scene, but not done as we should like to see them, for, of course, I was running another hare.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">If you do not answer this in four pages, I shall stop the enclosed fiver at the bank, a step which will lead to your incarceration for life.  As my visits to Arcady are somewhat uncertain, you had better address 17 Heriot Row, Edinburgh, as usual.  I shall walk over for the note if I am not yet home.—Believe me, very really yours,</p>

                     <p rend="justify">I see I must write some more to you about my Monastery.  I am a weak brother in verse.  You ask me to re-write things that I have already managed just to write with the skin of my teeth.  If I don’t re-write them, it’s because I don’t see how to write them better, not because I don’t think they should be.  But, curiously enough, you condemn two of my favourite passages, one of which is J. W. Ferrier’s favourite of the whole.  Here I shall think it’s you who are wrong.  You see, I did not try to make good verse, but to say what I wanted as well as verse would let me.  I don’t like the rhyme ‘ear’ and ‘hear.’  But the couplet, ‘My undissuaded heart I hear Whisper courage in my ear,’ is exactly what I want for the thought, and to me seems very energetic as speech, if not as verse.  Would ‘daring’ be better than ‘courage’?  <hi rend="italic">Je me le demande</hi>.  No, it would be ambiguous, as though I had used it licentiously for ‘daringly,’ and that would cloak the sense.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">In short, your suggestions have broken the heart of the scald.  He doesn’t agree with them all; and those he does agree with, the spirit indeed is willing, but the d-d flesh cannot, cannot, cannot, see its way to profit by.  I think I’ll lay it by for nine years, like Horace.  I think the well of Castaly’s run out.  No more the Muses round my pillow haunt.  I am fallen once more to the mere proser.  God bless you.</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR GOSSE,—I have greatly enjoyed your articles which seems to me handsome in tone, and written like a fine old English gentleman.  But is there not a hitch in the sentence at foot of page 153?  I get lost in it.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Chapters VIII. and IX. of Meredith’s story are very good, I think.  But who wrote the review of my book? whoever he was, he cannot write; he is humane, but a duffer; I could weep when I think of him; for surely to be virtuous and incompetent is a hard lot.  I should prefer to be a bold pirate, the gay sailor-boy of immorality, and a publisher at once.  My mind is extinct; my appetite is expiring; I have fallen altogether into a hollow-eyed, yawning way of life, like the parties in Burne Jones’s pictures. . . . Talking of Burns.  (Is this not sad, Weg?  I use the term of reproach not because I am angry with you this time, but because I am angry with myself and desire to give pain.)  Talking, I say, of Robert Burns, the inspired poet is a very gay subject for study.  I made a kind of chronological table of his various loves and lusts, and have been comparatively speechless ever since.  I am sorry to say it, but there was something in him of the vulgar, bagmanlike, professional seducer.—Oblige me by taking down and reading, for the hundredth time I hope, his ‘Twa Dogs’ and his ‘Address to the Unco Guid.’  I am only a Scotchman, after all, you see; and when I have beaten Burns, I am driven at once, by my parental feelings, to console him with a sugar-plum.  But hang me if I know anything I like so well as the ‘Twa Dogs.’  Even a common Englishman may have a glimpse, as it were from Pisgah, of its extraordinary merits.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">‘<hi rend="italic">English</hi>, <hi rend="italic">The</hi>:—a dull people, incapable of comprehending the Scottish tongue.  Their history is so intimately connected with that of Scotland, that we must refer our readers to that heading.  Their literature is principally the work of venal Scots.’—Stevenson’s <hi rend="italic">Handy Cyclopædia</hi>.  Glescow: Blaikie &amp; Bannock.</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR COLVIN,—I am just in the middle of your Rembrandt.  The taste for Bummkopf and his works is agreeably dissembled so far as I have gone; and the reins have never for an instant been thrown upon the neck of that wooden Pegasus; he only perks up a learned snout from a footnote in the cellarage of a paragraph; just, in short, where he ought to be, to inspire confidence in a wicked and adulterous generation.  But, mind you, Bummkopf is not human; he is Dagon the fish god, and down he will come, sprawling on his belly or his behind, with his hands broken from his helpless carcase, and his head rolling off into a corner.  Up will rise on the other side, sane, pleasurable, human knowledge: a thing of beauty and a joy, etc.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I’m three parts through Burns; long, dry, unsympathetic, but sound and, I think, in its dry way, interesting.  Next I shall finish the story, and then perhaps Thoreau.  Meredith has been staying with Morley, who is about, it is believed, to write to me on a literary scheme.  Is it Keats, hope you?  My heart leaps at the thought.—Yours ever,</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR GOSSE,—Yours was delicious; you are a young person of wit; one of the last of them; wit being quite out of date, and humour confined to the Scotch Church and the <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi> in unconscious survival.  You will probably be glad to hear that I am up again in the world; I have breathed again, and had a frolic on the strength of it.  The frolic was yesterday, Sawbath; the scene, the Royal Hotel, Bathgate; I went there with a humorous friend to lunch.  The maid soon showed herself a lass of character.  She was looking out of window.  On being asked what she was after, ‘I’m lookin’ for my lad,’ says she.  ‘Is that him?’  ‘Weel, I’ve been lookin’ for him a’ my life, and I’ve never seen him yet,’ was the response.  I wrote her some verses in the vernacular; she read them.  ‘They’re no bad for a beginner,’ said she.  The landlord’s daughter, Miss Stewart, was present in oil colour; so I wrote her a declaration in verse, and sent it by the handmaid.  She (Miss S.) was present on the stair to witness our departure, in a warm, suffused condition.  Damn it, Gosse, you needn’t suppose that you’re the only poet in the world.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Your statement about your initials, it will be seen, I pass over in contempt and silence.  When once I have made up my mind, let me tell you, sir, there lives no pock-pudding who can change it.  Your anger I defy.  Your unmanly reference to a well-known statesman I puff from me, sir, like so much vapour.  Weg is your name; Weg.  W E G.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">My enthusiasm has kind of dropped from me.  I envy you your wife, your home, your child—I was going to say your cat.  There would be cats in my home too if I could but get it.  I may seem to you ‘the impersonation of life,’ but my life is the impersonation of waiting, and that’s a poor creature.  God help us all, and the deil be kind to the hindmost!  Upon my word, we are a brave, cheery crew, we human beings, and my admiration increases daily—primarily for myself, but by a roundabout process for the whole crowd; for I dare say they have all their poor little secrets and anxieties.  And here am I, for instance, writing to you as if you were in the seventh heaven, and yet I know you are in a sad anxiety yourself.  I hope earnestly it will soon be over, and a fine pink Gosse sprawling in a tub, and a mother in the best of health and spirits, glad and tired, and with another interest in life.  Man, you are out of the trouble when this is through.  A first child is a rival, but a second is only a rival to the first; and the husband stands his ground and may keep married all his life—a consummation heartily to be desired.  Good-bye, Gosse.  Write me a witty letter with good news of the mistress.</p>

                     <p rend="justify">DEAR COLVIN,—I am in the cars between Pittsburgh and Chicago, just now bowling through Ohio.  I am taking charge of a kid, whose mother is asleep, with one eye, while I write you this with the other.  I reached N.Y. Sunday night; and by five o’clock Monday was under way for the West.  It is now about ten on Wednesday morning, so I have already been about forty hours in the cars.  It is impossible to lie down in them, which must end by being very wearying.</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR HENLEY,—I am sitting on the top of the cars with a mill party from Missouri going west for his health.  Desolate flat prairie upon all hands.  Here and there a herd of cattle, a yellow butterfly or two; a patch of wild sunflowers; a wooden house or two; then a wooden church alone in miles of waste; then a windmill to pump water.  When we stop, which we do often, for emigrants and freight travel together, the kine first, the men after, the whole plain is heard singing with cicadae.  This is a pause, as you may see from the writing.  What happened to the old pedestrian emigrants, what was the tedium suffered by the Indians and trappers of our youth, the imagination trembles to conceive.  This is now Saturday, 23rd, and I have been steadily travelling since I parted from you at St. Pancras.  It is a strange vicissitude from the Savile Club to this; I sleep with a man from Pennsylvania who has been in the States Navy, and mess with him and the Missouri bird already alluded to.  We have a tin wash-bowl among four.  I wear nothing but a shirt and a pair of trousers, and never button my shirt.  When I land for a meal, I pass my coat and feel dressed.  This life is to last till Friday, Saturday, or Sunday next.  It is a strange affair to be an emigrant, as I hope you shall see in a future work.  I wonder if this will be legible; my present station on the waggon roof, though airy compared to the cars, is both dirty and insecure.  I can see the track straight before and straight behind me to either horizon.  Peace of mind I enjoy with extreme serenity; I am doing right; I know no one will think so; and don’t care.  My body, however, is all to whistles; I don’t eat; but, man, I can sleep.  The car in front of mine is chock full of Chinese.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">
                        <hi rend="italic">Monday</hi>.—What it is to be ill in an emigrant train let those declare who know.  I slept none till late in the morning, overcome with laudanum, of which I had luckily a little bottle.  All to-day I have eaten nothing, and only drunk two cups of tea, for each of which, on the pretext that the one was breakfast, and the other dinner, I was charged fifty cents.  Our journey is through ghostly deserts, sage brush and alkali, and rocks, without form or colour, a sad corner of the world.  I confess I am not jolly, but mighty calm, in my distresses.  My illness is a subject of great mirth to some of my fellow-travellers, and I smile rather sickly at their jests.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">We are going along Bitter Creek just now, a place infamous in the history of emigration, a place I shall remember myself among the blackest.  I hope I may get this posted at Ogden, Utah.</p>

                     <p rend="justify">Here is another curious start in my life.  I am living at an Angora goat-ranche, in the Coast Line Mountains, eighteen miles from Monterey.  I was camping out, but got so sick that the two rancheros took me in and tended me.  One is an old bear-hunter, seventy-two years old, and a captain from the Mexican war; the other a pilgrim, and one who was out with the bear flag and under Fremont when California was taken by the States.  They are both true frontiersmen, and most kind and pleasant.  Captain Smith, the bear-hunter, is my physician, and I obey him like an oracle.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">The business of my life stands pretty nigh still.  I work at my notes of the voyage.  It will not be very like a book of mine; but perhaps none the less successful for that.  I will not deny that I feel lonely to-day; but I do not fear to go on, for I am doing right.  I have not yet had a word from England, partly, I suppose, because I have not yet written for my letters to New York; do not blame me for this neglect; if you knew all I have been through, you would wonder I had done so much as I have.  I teach the ranche children reading in the morning, for the mother is from home sick.—Ever your affectionate friend,</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR WEG,—I know I am a rogue and the son of a dog.  Yet let me tell you, when I came here I had a week’s misery and a fortnight’s illness, and since then I have been more or less busy in being content.  This is a kind of excuse for my laziness.  I hope you will not excuse yourself.  My plans are still very uncertain, and it is not likely that anything will happen before Christmas.  In the meanwhile, I believe I shall live on here ‘between the sandhills and the sea,’ as I think Mr. Swinburne hath it.  I was pretty nearly slain; my spirit lay down and kicked for three days; I was up at an Angora goat-ranche in the Santa Lucia Mountains, nursed by an old frontiers-man, a mighty hunter of bears, and I scarcely slept, or ate, or thought for four days.  Two nights I lay out under a tree in a sort of stupor, doing nothing but fetch water for myself and horse, light a fire and make coffee, and all night awake hearing the goat-bells ringing and the tree-frogs singing when each new noise was enough to set me mad.  Then the bear-hunter came round, pronounced me ‘real sick,’ and ordered me up to the ranche.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">It was an odd, miserable piece of my life; and according to all rule, it should have been my death; but after a while my spirit got up again in a divine frenzy, and has since kicked and spurred my vile body forward with great emphasis and success.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">My new book, <hi rend="italic">The Amateur Emigrant</hi>, is about half drafted.  I don’t know if it will be good, but I think it ought to sell in spite of the deil and the publishers; for it tells an odd enough experience, and one, I think, never yet told before.  Look for my ‘Burns’ in the <hi rend="italic">Cornhill</hi>, and for my ‘Story of a Lie’ in Paul’s withered babe, the <hi rend="italic">New Quarterly</hi>.  You may have seen the latter ere this reaches you: tell me if it has any interest, like a good boy, and remember that it was written at sea in great anxiety of mind.  What is your news?  Send me your works, like an angel, <hi rend="italic">au fur et à mesure</hi> of their apparition, for I am naturally short of literature, and I do not wish to rust.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I fear this can hardly be called a letter.  To say truth, I feel already a difficulty of approach; I do not know if I am the same man I was in Europe, perhaps I can hardly claim acquaintance with you.  My head went round and looks another way now; for when I found myself over here in a new land, and all the past uprooted in the one tug, and I neither feeling glad nor sorry, I got my last lesson about mankind; I mean my latest lesson, for of course I do not know what surprises there are yet in store for me.  But that I could have so felt astonished me beyond description.  There is a wonderful callousness in human nature which enables us to live.  I had no feeling one way or another, from New York to California, until, at Dutch Flat, a mining camp in the Sierra, I heard a cock crowing with a home voice; and then I fell to hope and regret both in the same moment.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Is there a boy or a girl? and how is your wife?  I thought of you more than once, to put it mildly.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I live here comfortably enough; but I shall soon be left all alone, perhaps till Christmas.  Then you may hope for correspondence—and may not I?—Your friend,</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR HENLEY,—Many thanks for your good letter, which is the best way to forgive you for your previous silence.  I hope Colvin or somebody has sent me the <hi rend="italic">Cornhill</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">New Quarterly</hi>, though I am trying to get them in San Francisco.  I think you might have sent me (1) some of your articles in the P. M. G.; (2) a paper with the announcement of second edition; and (3) the announcement of the essays in <hi rend="italic">Athenæum</hi>.  This to prick you in the future.  Again, choose, in your head, the best volume of Labiche there is, and post it to Jules Simoneau, Monterey, Monterey Co., California: do this at once, as he is my restaurant man, a most pleasant old boy with whom I discuss the universe and play chess daily.  He has been out of France for thirty-five years, and never heard of Labiche.  I have eighty-three pages written of a story called a <hi rend="italic">Vendetta in the West</hi>, and about sixty pages of the first draft of the <hi rend="italic">Amateur Emigrant</hi>.  They should each cover from 130 to 150 pages when done.  That is all my literary news.  Do keep me posted, won’t you?  Your letter and Bob’s made the fifth and sixth I have had from Europe in three months.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">At times I get terribly frightened about my work, which seems to advance too slowly.  I hope soon to have a greater burthen to support, and must make money a great deal quicker than I used.  I may get nothing for the <hi rend="italic">Vendetta</hi>; I may only get some forty quid for the <hi rend="italic">Emigrant</hi>; I cannot hope to have them both done much before the end of November.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">O, and look here, why did you not send me the <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi> which slanged me?  Rogues and rascals, is that all you are worth?</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Yesterday I set fire to the forest, for which, had I been caught, I should have been hung out of hand to the nearest tree, Judge Lynch being an active person hereaway.  You should have seen my retreat (which was entirely for strategical purposes).  I ran like hell.  It was a fine sight.  At night I went out again to see it; it was a good fire, though I say it that should not.  I had a near escape for my life with a revolver: I fired six charges, and the six bullets all remained in the barrel, which was choked from end to end, from muzzle to breach, with solid lead; it took a man three hours to drill them out.  Another shot, and I’d have gone to kingdom come.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">This is a lovely place, which I am growing to love.  The Pacific licks all other oceans out of hand; there is no place but the Pacific Coast to hear eternal roaring surf.  When I get to the top of the woods behind Monterey, I can hear the seas breaking all round over ten or twelve miles of coast from near Carmel on my left, out to Point Pinas in front, and away to the right along the sands of Monterey to Castroville and the mouth of the Salinas.  I was wishing yesterday that the world could get—no, what I mean was that you should be kept in suspense like Mahomet’s coffin until the world had made half a revolution, then dropped here at the station as though you had stepped from the cars; you would then comfortably enter Walter’s waggon (the sun has just gone down, the moon beginning to throw shadows, you hear the surf rolling, and smell the sea and the pines).  That shall deposit you at Sanchez’s saloon, where we take a drink; you are introduced to Bronson, the local editor (‘I have no brain music,’ he says; ‘I’m a mechanic, you see,’ but he’s a nice fellow); to Adolpho Sanchez, who is delightful.  Meantime I go to the P. O. for my mail; thence we walk up Alvarado Street together, you now floundering in the sand, now merrily stumping on the wooden side-walks; I call at Hadsell’s for my paper; at length behold us installed in Simoneau’s little white-washed back-room, round a dirty tablecloth, with François the baker, perhaps an Italian fisherman, perhaps Augustin Dutra, and Simoneau himself.  Simoneau, François, and I are the three sure cards; the others mere waifs.  Then home to my great airy rooms with five windows opening on a balcony; I sleep on the floor in my camp blankets; you instal yourself abed; in the morning coffee with the little doctor and his little wife; we hire a waggon and make a day of it; and by night, I should let you up again into the air, to be returned to Mrs. Henley in the forenoon following.  By God, you would enjoy yourself.  So should I.  I have tales enough to keep you going till five in the morning, and then they would not be at an end.  I forget if you asked me any questions, and I sent your letter up to the city to one who will like to read it.  I expect other letters now steadily.  If I have to wait another two months, I shall begin to be happy.  Will you remember me most affectionately to your wife?  Shake hands with Anthony from me; and God bless your mother.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">God bless Stephen!  Does he not know that I am a man, and cannot live by bread alone, but must have guineas into the bargain.  Burns, I believe, in my own mind, is one of my high-water marks; Meiklejohn flames me a letter about it, which is so complimentary that I must keep it or get it published in the <hi rend="italic">Monterey Californian</hi>.  Some of these days I shall send an exemplaire of that paper; it is huge.—Ever your affectionate friend,</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR MR. HAMERTON,—Your letter to my father was forwarded to me by mistake, and by mistake I opened it.  The letter to myself has not yet reached me.  This must explain my own and my father’s silence.  I shall write by this or next post to the only friends I have who, I think, would have an influence, as they are both professors.  I regret exceedingly that I am not in Edinburgh, as I could perhaps have done more, and I need not tell you that what I might do for you in the matter of the election is neither from friendship nor gratitude, but because you are the only man (I beg your pardon) worth a damn.  I shall write to a third friend, now I think of it, whose father will have great influence.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I find here (of all places in the world) your <hi rend="italic">Essays on Art</hi>, which I have read with signal interest.  I believe I shall dig an essay of my own out of one of them, for it set me thinking; if mine could only produce yet another in reply, we could have the marrow out between us.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I hope, my dear sir, you will not think badly of me for my long silence.  My head has scarce been on my shoulders.  I had scarce recovered from a long fit of useless ill-health than I was whirled over here double-quick time and by cheapest conveyance.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I have been since pretty ill, but pick up, though still somewhat of a mossy ruin.  If you would view my countenance aright, come—view it by the pale moonlight.  But that is on the mend.  I believe I have now a distant claim to tan.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">A letter will be more than welcome in this distant clime where I have a box at the post-office—generally, I regret to say, empty.  Could your recommendation introduce me to an American publisher?  My next book I should really try to get hold of here, as its interest is international, and the more I am in this country the more I understand the weight of your influence.  It is pleasant to be thus most at home abroad, above all, when the prophet is still not without honour in his own land. . . .</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR GOSSE,—Your letter was to me such a bright spot that I answer it right away to the prejudice of other correspondents or -dants (don’t know how to spell it) who have prior claims. . . . It is the history of our kindnesses that alone makes this world tolerable.  If it were not for that, for the effect of kind words, kind looks, kind letters, multiplying, spreading, making one happy through another and bringing forth benefits, some thirty, some fifty, some a thousandfold, I should be tempted to think our life a practical jest in the worst possible spirit.  So your four pages have confirmed my philosophy as well as consoled my heart in these ill hours.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Yes, you are right; Monterey is a pleasant place; but I see I can write no more to-night.  I am tired and sad, and being already in bed, have no more to do but turn out the light.—Your affectionate friend,</p>
                     <p rend="justify">R. L S.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I try it again by daylight.  Once more in bed however; for to-day it is <hi rend="italic">mucho </hi>
                        <hi rend="italic">frio</hi>, as we Spaniards say; and I had no other means of keeping warm for my work.  I have done a good spell, 9½ foolscap pages; at least 8 of <hi rend="italic">Cornhill</hi>; ah, if I thought that I could get eight guineas for it.  My trouble is that I am all too ambitious just now.  A book whereof 70 out of 120 are scrolled.  A novel whereof 85 out of, say, 140 are pretty well nigh done.  A short story of 50 pp., which shall be finished to-morrow, or I’ll know the reason why.  This may bring in a lot of money: but I dread to think that it is all on three chances.  If the three were to fail, I am in a bog.  The novel is called <hi rend="italic">A Vendetta in the West</hi>.  I see I am in a grasping, dismal humour, and should, as we Americans put it, quit writing.  In truth, I am so haunted by anxieties that one or other is sure to come up in all that I write.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I will send you herewith a Monterey paper where the works of R. L. S. appear, nor only that, but all my life on studying the advertisements will become clear.  I lodge with Dr. Heintz; take my meals with Simoneau; have been only two days ago shaved by the tonsorial artist Michaels; drink daily at the Bohemia saloon; get my daily paper from Hadsel’s; was stood a drink to-day by Albano Rodriguez; in short, there is scarce a person advertised in that paper but I know him, and I may add scarce a person in Monterey but is there advertised.  The paper is the marrow of the place.  Its bones—pooh, I am tired of writing so sillily.</p>

                     <p rend="justify">To-day, my dear Colvin, I send you the first part of the <hi rend="italic">Amateur Emigrant</hi>, 71 pp., by far the longest and the best of the whole.  It is not a monument of eloquence; indeed, I have sought to be prosaic in view of the nature of the subject; but I almost think it is interesting.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Whatever is done about any book publication, two things remember: I must keep a royalty; and, second, I must have all my books advertised, in the French manner, on the leaf opposite the title.  I know from my own experience how much good this does an author with book <hi rend="italic">buyers</hi>.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">The entire A. E. will be a little longer than the two others, but not very much.  Here and there, I fancy, you will laugh as you read it; but it seems to me rather a <hi rend="italic">clever</hi> book than anything else: the book of a man, that is, who has paid a great deal of attention to contemporary life, and not through the newspapers.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I have never seen my Burns! the darling of my heart!  I await your promised letter.  Papers, magazines, articles by friends; reviews of myself, all would be very welcome, I am reporter for the <hi rend="italic">Monterey Californian</hi>, at a salary of two dollars a week!  <hi rend="italic">Comment trouvez-vous ça</hi>?  I am also in a conspiracy with the American editor, a French restaurant-man, and an Italian fisherman against the Padre.  The enclosed poster is my last literary appearance.  It was put up to the number of 200 exemplaires at the witching hour; and they were almost all destroyed by eight in the morning.  But I think the nickname will stick.  Dos Reales; deux réaux; two bits; twenty-five cents; about a shilling; but in practice it is worth from ninepence to threepence: thus two glasses of beer would cost two bits.  The Italian fisherman, an old Garibaldian, is a splendid fellow.</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR WEG,—I received your book last night as I lay abed with a pleurisy, the result, I fear, of overwork, gradual decline of appetite, etc.  You know what a wooden-hearted curmudgeon I am about contemporary verse.  I like none of it, except some of my own.  (I look back on that sentence with pleasure; it comes from an honest heart.)  Hence you will be kind enough to take this from me in a kindly spirit; the piece ‘To my daughter’ is delicious.  And yet even here I am going to pick holes.  I am a <hi rend="italic">beastly</hi> curmudgeon.  It is the last verse.  ‘Newly budded’ is off the venue; and haven’t you gone ahead to make a poetry daybreak instead of sticking to your muttons, and comparing with the mysterious light of stars the plain, friendly, perspicuous, human day?  But this is to be a beast.  The little poem is eminently pleasant, human, and original.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I have read nearly the whole volume, and shall read it nearly all over again; you have no rivals!</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Bancroft’s <hi rend="italic">History of the United States</hi>, even in a centenary edition, is essentially heavy fare; a little goes a long way; I respect Bancroft, but I do not love him; he has moments when he feels himself inspired to open up his improvisations upon universal history and the designs of God; but I flatter myself I am more nearly acquainted with the latter than Mr. Bancroft.  A man, in the words of my Plymouth Brother, ‘who knows the Lord,’ must needs, from time to time, write less emphatically.  It is a fetter dance to the music of minute guns—not at sea, but in a region not a thousand miles from the Sahara.  Still, I am half-way through volume three, and shall count myself unworthy of the name of an Englishman if I do not see the back of volume six.  The countryman of Livingstone, Burton, Speke, Drake, Cook, etc.!</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I have been sweated not only out of my pleuritic fever, but out of all my eating cares, and the better part of my brains (strange coincidence!), by aconite.  I have that peculiar and delicious sense of being born again in an expurgated edition which belongs to convalescence.  It will not be for long; I hear the breakers roar; I shall be steering head first for another rapid before many days; <hi rend="italic">nitor aquis</hi>, said a certain Eton boy, translating for his sins a part of the <hi rend="italic">Inland Voyage</hi> into Latin elegiacs; and from the hour I saw it, or rather a friend of mine, the admirable Jenkin, saw and recognised its absurd appropriateness, I took it for my device in life.  I am going for thirty now; and unless I can snatch a little rest before long, I have, I may tell you in confidence, no hope of seeing thirty-one.  My health began to break last winter, and has given me but fitful times since then.  This pleurisy, though but a slight affair in itself was a huge disappointment to me, and marked an epoch.  To start a pleurisy about nothing, while leading a dull, regular life in a mild climate, was not my habit in past days; and it is six years, all but a few months, since I was obliged to spend twenty-four hours in bed.  I may be wrong, but if the niting is to continue, I believe I must go.  It is a pity in one sense, for I believe the class of work I <hi rend="italic">might</hi> yet give out is better and more real and solid than people fancy.  But death is no bad friend; a few aches and gasps, and we are done; like the truant child, I am beginning to grow weary and timid in this big jostling city, and could run to my nurse, even although she should have to whip me before putting me to bed.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Will you kiss your little daughter from me, and tell her that her father has written a delightful poem about her?  Remember me, please, to Mrs. Gosse, to Middlemore, to whom some of these days I will write, to —, to —, yes, to —, and to —.  I know you will gnash your teeth at some of these; wicked, grim, catlike old poet.  If I were God, I would sort you—as we say in Scotland.—Your sincere friend,</p>

                     <p rend="justify">O Colvin, you don’t know how much good I have done myself.  I feared to think this out by myself.  I have made a base use of you, and it comes out so much better than I had dreamed.  But I have to stick to work now; and here’s December gone pretty near useless.  But, Lord love you, October and November saw a great harvest.  It might have affected the price of paper on the Pacific coast.  As for ink, they haven’t any, not what I call ink; only stuff to write cookery-books with, or the works of Hayley, or the pallid perambulations of the—I can find nobody to beat Hayley.  I like good, knock-me-down black-strap to write with; that makes a mark and done with it.—By the way, I have tried to read the <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi>, which they all say I imitate, and—it’s very wrong of me, I know—but I can’t.  It’s all very fine, you know, and all that, but it’s vapid.  They have just played the overture to <hi rend="italic">Norma</hi>, and I know it’s a good one, for I bitterly wanted the opera to go on; I had just got thoroughly interested—and then no curtain to rise.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I have written myself into a kind of spirits, bless your dear heart, by your leave.  But this is wild work for me, nearly nine and me not back!  What will Mrs. Carson think of me!  Quite a night-hawk, I do declare.  You are the worst correspondent in the world—no, not that, Henley is that—well, I don’t know, I leave the pair of you to Him that made you—surely with small attention.  But here’s my service, and I’ll away home to my den O! much the better for this crack, Professor Colvin.</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR COLVIN,—This is a circular letter to tell my estate fully.  You have no right to it, being the worst of correspondents; but I wish to efface the impression of my last, so to you it goes.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Any time between eight and half-past nine in the morning, a slender gentleman in an ulster, with a volume buttoned into the breast of it, may be observed leaving No. 608 Bush and descending Powell with an active step.  The gentleman is R. L. S.; the volume relates to Benjamin Franklin, on whom he meditates one of his charming essays.  He descends Powell, crosses Market, and descends in Sixth on a branch of the original Pine Street Coffee House, no less; I believe he would be capable of going to the original itself, if he could only find it.  In the branch he seats himself at a table covered with waxcloth, and a pampered menial, of High-Dutch extraction and, indeed, as yet only partially extracted, lays before him a cup of coffee, a roll and a pat of butter, all, to quote the deity, very good.  A while ago, and R. L. S. used to find the supply of butter insufficient; but he has now learned the art to exactitude, and butter and roll expire at the same moment.  For this refection he pays ten cents., or five pence sterling (£0, 0s. 5d.).</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Half an hour later, the inhabitants of Bush Street observe the same slender gentleman armed, like George Washington, with his little hatchet, splitting, kindling and breaking coal for his fire.  He does this quasi-publicly upon the window-sill; but this is not to be attributed to any love of notoriety, though he is indeed vain of his prowess with the hatchet (which he persists in calling an axe), and daily surprised at the perpetuation of his fingers.  The reason is this: that the sill is a strong, supporting beam, and that blows of the same emphasis in other parts of his room might knock the entire shanty into hell.  Thenceforth, for from three to four hours, he is engaged darkly with an inkbottle.  Yet he is not blacking his boots, for the only pair that he possesses are innocent of lustre and wear the natural hue of the material turned up with caked and venerable slush.  The youngest child of his landlady remarks several times a day, as this strange occupant enters or quits the house, ‘Dere’s de author.’  Can it be that this bright-haired innocent has found the true clue to the mystery?  The being in question is, at least, poor enough to belong to that honourable craft.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">His next appearance is at the restaurant of one Donadieu, in Bush Street, between Dupont and Kearney, where a copious meal, half a bottle of wine, coffee and brandy may be procured for the sum of four bits, <hi rend="italic">alias</hi> fifty cents., £0, 2s. 2d. sterling.  The wine is put down in a whole bottleful, and it is strange and painful to observe the greed with which the gentleman in question seeks to secure the last drop of his allotted half, and the scrupulousness with which he seeks to avoid taking the first drop of the other.  This is partly explained by the fact that if he were to go over the mark—bang would go a tenpence.  He is again armed with a book, but his best friends will learn with pain that he seems at this hour to have deserted the more serious studies of the morning.  When last observed, he was studying with apparent zest the exploits of one Rocambole by the late Viscomte Ponson du Terrail.  This work, originally of prodigious dimensions, he had cut into liths or thicknesses apparently for convenience of carriage.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Then the being walks, where is not certain.  But by about half-past four, a light beams from the windows of 608 Bush, and he may be observed sometimes engaged in correspondence, sometimes once again plunged in the mysterious rites of the forenoon.  About six he returns to the Branch Original, where he once more imbrues himself to the worth of fivepence in coffee and roll.  The evening is devoted to writing and reading, and by eleven or half-past darkness closes over this weird and truculent existence.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">As for coin, you see I don’t spend much, only you and Henley both seem to think my work rather bosh nowadays, and I do want to make as much as I was making, that is £200; if I can do that, I can swim: last year, with my ill health I touched only £109, that would not do, I could not fight it through on that; but on £200, as I say, I am good for the world, and can even in this quiet way save a little, and that I must do.  The worst is my health; it is suspected I had an ague chill yesterday; I shall know by to-morrow, and you know if I am to be laid down with ague the game is pretty well lost.  But I don’t know; I managed to write a good deal down in Monterey, when I was pretty sickly most of the time, and, by God, I’ll try, ague and all.  I have to ask you frankly, when you write, to give me any good news you can, and chat a little, but <hi rend="italic">just in the meantime</hi>, give me no bad.  If I could get <hi rend="italic">Thoreau</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Emigrant</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Vendetta</hi> all finished and out of my hand, I should feel like a man who had made half a year’s income in a half year; but until the two last are <hi rend="italic">finished</hi>, you see, they don’t fairly count.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I am afraid I bore you sadly with this perpetual talk about my affairs; I will try and stow it; but you see, it touches me nearly.  I’m the miser in earnest now: last night, when I felt so ill, the supposed ague chill, it seemed strange not to be able to afford a drink.  I would have walked half a mile, tired as I felt, for a brandy and soda.—Ever yours,</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR COLVIN,—I received this morning your long letter from Paris.  Well, God’s will be done; if it’s dull, it’s dull; it was a fair fight, and it’s lost, and there’s an end.  But, fortunately, dulness is not a fault the public hates; perhaps they may like this vein of dulness.  If they don’t, damn them, we’ll try them with another.  I sat down on the back of your letter, and wrote twelve Cornhill pages this day as ever was of that same despised <hi rend="italic">Emigrant</hi>; so you see my moral courage has not gone down with my intellect.  Only, frankly, Colvin, do you think it a good plan to be so eminently descriptive, and even eloquent in dispraise?  You rolled such a lot of polysyllables over me that a better man than I might have been disheartened.—However, I was not, as you see, and am not.  The <hi rend="italic">Emigrant</hi> shall be finished and leave in the course of next week.  And then, I’ll stick to stories.  I am not frightened.  I know my mind is changing; I have been telling you so for long; and I suppose I am fumbling for the new vein.  Well, I’ll find it.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">The <hi rend="italic">Vendetta</hi> you will not much like, I dare say: and that must be finished next; but I’ll knock you with <hi rend="italic">The Forest State</hi>: <hi rend="italic">A Romance</hi>.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I’m vexed about my letters; I know it is painful to get these unsatisfactory things; but at least I have written often enough.  And not one soul ever gives me any <hi rend="italic">news</hi>, about people or things; everybody writes me sermons; it’s good for me, but hardly the food necessary for a man who lives all alone on forty-five cents. a day, and sometimes less, with quantities of hard work and many heavy thoughts.  If one of you could write me a letter with a jest in it, a letter like what is written to real people in this world—I am still flesh and blood—I should enjoy it.  Simpson did, the other day, and it did me as much good as a bottle of wine.  A lonely man gets to feel like a pariah after awhile—or no, not that, but like a saint and martyr, or a kind of macerated clergyman with pebbles in his boots, a pillared Simeon, I’m damned if I know what, but, man alive, I want gossip.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">My health is better, my spirits steadier, I am not the least cast down.  If the <hi rend="italic">Emigrant</hi> was a failure, the <hi rend="italic">Pavilion</hi>, by your leave, was not: it was a story quite adequately and rightly done, I contend; and when I find Stephen, for whom certainly I did not mean it, taking it in, I am better pleased with it than before.  I know I shall do better work than ever I have done before; but, mind you, it will not be like it.  My sympathies and interests are changed.  There shall be no more books of travel for me.  I care for nothing but the moral and the dramatic, not a jot for the picturesque or the beautiful other than about people.  It bored me hellishly to write the <hi rend="italic">Emigrant</hi>; well, it’s going to bore others to read it; that’s only fair.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I should also write to others; but indeed I am jack-tired, and must go to bed to a French novel to compose myself for slumber.—Ever your affectionate friend,</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR HENLEY,—Before my work or anything I sit down to answer your long and kind letter.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I am well, cheerful, busy, hopeful; I cannot be knocked down; I do not mind about the <hi rend="italic">Emigrant</hi>.  I never thought it a masterpiece.  It was written to sell, and I believe it will sell; and if it does not, the next will.  You need not be uneasy about my work; I am only beginning to see my true method.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">(1) As to <hi rend="italic">Studies</hi>.  There are two more already gone to Stephen. <hi rend="italic">Yoshida Torajiro</hi>, which I think temperate and adequate; and <hi rend="italic">Thoreau</hi>, which will want a really Balzacian effort over the proofs.  But I want <hi rend="italic">Benjamin Franklin and the Art of Virtue</hi> to follow; and perhaps also <hi rend="italic">William Penn</hi>, but this last may be perhaps delayed for another volume—I think not, though.  The <hi rend="italic">Studies</hi> will be an intelligent volume, and in their latter numbers more like what I mean to be my style, or I mean what my style means to be, for I am passive.  (2) The <hi rend="italic">Essays</hi>.  Good news indeed.  I think <hi rend="italic">Ordered South</hi> must be thrown in.  It always swells the volume, and it will never find a more appropriate place.  It was May 1874, Macmillan, I believe.  (3) <hi rend="italic">Plays</hi>.  I did not understand you meant to try the draft.  I shall make you a full scenario as soon as the <hi rend="italic">Emigrant</hi> is done.  (4) <hi rend="italic">Emigrant</hi>.  He shall be sent off next week.  (5) Stories.  You need not be alarmed that I am going to imitate Meredith.  You know I was a Story-teller ingrain; did not that reassure you?  The <hi rend="italic">Vendetta</hi>, which falls next to be finished, is not entirely pleasant.  But it has points.  <hi rend="italic">The Forest State</hi> or <hi rend="italic">The</hi> 
                        <hi rend="italic">Greenwood State</hi>: <hi rend="italic">A Romance</hi>, is another pair of shoes.  It is my old Semiramis, our half-seen Duke and Duchess, which suddenly sprang into sunshine clearness as a story the other day.  The kind, happy <hi rend="italic">dénouement</hi> is unfortunately absolutely undramatic, which will be our only trouble in quarrying out the play.  I mean we shall quarry from it.  <hi rend="italic">Characters</hi>—Otto Frederick John, hereditary Prince of Grünwald; Amelia Seraphina, Princess; Conrad, Baron Gondremarck, Prime Minister; Cancellarius Greisengesang; Killian Gottesacker, Steward of the River Farm; Ottilie, his daughter; the Countess von Rosen.  Seven in all.  A brave story, I swear; and a brave play too, if we can find the trick to make the end.  The play, I fear, will have to end darkly, and that spoils the quality as I now see it of a kind of crockery, eighteenth century, high-life-below-stairs life, breaking up like ice in spring before the nature and the certain modicum of manhood of my poor, clever, feather-headed Prince, whom I love already.  I see Seraphina too.  Gondremarck is not quite so clear.  The Countess von Rosen, I have; I’ll never tell you who she is; it’s a secret; but I have known the countess; well, I will tell you; it’s my old Russian friend, Madame Z.  Certain scenes are, in conception, the best I have ever made, except for <hi rend="italic">Hester Noble</hi>.  Those at the end, Von Rosen and the Princess, the Prince and Princess, and the Princess and Gondremarck, as I now see them from here, should be nuts, Henley, nuts.  It irks me not to go to them straight.  But the <hi rend="italic">Emigrant</hi> stops the way; then a reassured scenario for <hi rend="italic">Hester</hi>; then the <hi rend="italic">Vendetta</hi>; then two (or three) Essays—Benjamin Franklin, Thoughts on Literature as an Art, Dialogue on Character and Destiny between two Puppets, The Human Compromise; and then, at length—come to me, my Prince.  O Lord, it’s going to be courtly!  And there is not an ugly person nor an ugly scene in it.  The <hi rend="italic">Slate</hi> both Fanny and I have damned utterly; it is too morbid, ugly, and unkind; better starvation.</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR GOSSE,—You have not answered my last; and I know you will repent when you hear how near I have been to another world.  For about six weeks I have been in utter doubt; it was a toss-up for life or death all that time; but I won the toss, sir, and Hades went off once more discomfited.  This is not the first time, nor will it be the last, that I have a friendly game with that gentleman.  I know he will end by cleaning me out; but the rogue is insidious, and the habit of that sort of gambling seems to be a part of my nature; it was, I suspect, too much indulged in youth; break your children of this tendency, my dear Gosse, from the first.  It is, when once formed, a habit more fatal than opium—I speak, as St. Paul says, like a fool.  I have been very very sick; on the verge of a galloping consumption, cold sweats, prostrating attacks of cough, sinking fits in which I lost the power of speech, fever, and all the ugliest circumstances of the disease; and I have cause to bless God, my wife that is to be, and one Dr. Bamford (a name the Muse repels), that I have come out of all this, and got my feet once more upon a little hilltop, with a fair prospect of life and some new desire of living.  Yet I did not wish to die, neither; only I felt unable to go on farther with that rough horseplay of human life: a man must be pretty well to take the business in good part.  Yet I felt all the time that I had done nothing to entitle me to an honourable discharge; that I had taken up many obligations and begun many friendships which I had no right to put away from me; and that for me to die was to play the cur and slinking sybarite, and desert the colours on the eve of the decisive fight.  Of course I have done no work for I do not know how long; and here you can triumph.  I have been reduced to writing verses for amusement.  A fact.  The whirligig of time brings in its revenges, after all.  But I’ll have them buried with me, I think, for I have not the heart to burn them while I live.  Do write.  I shall go to the mountains as soon as the weather clears; on the way thither, I marry myself; then I set up my family altar among the pinewoods, 3000 feet, sir, from the disputatious sea.—I am, dear Weg, most truly yours,</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR COLVIN,—I received your letter and proof to-day, and was greatly delighted with the last.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I am now out of danger; in but a short while (<hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> as soon as the weather is settled), F. and I marry and go up to the hills to look for a place; ‘I to the hills will lift mine eyes, from whence doth come mine aid’: once the place found, the furniture will follow.  There, sir, in, I hope, a ranche among the pine-trees and hard by a running brook, we are to fish, hunt, sketch, study Spanish, French, Latin, Euclid, and History; and, if possible, not quarrel.  Far from man, sir, in the virgin forest.  Thence, as my strength returns, you may expect works of genius.  I always feel as if I must write a work of genius some time or other; and when is it more likely to come off, than just after I have paid a visit to Styx and go thence to the eternal mountains?  Such a revolution in a man’s affairs, as I have somewhere written, would set anybody singing.  When we get installed, Lloyd and I are going to print my poetical works; so all those who have been poetically addressed shall receive copies of their addresses.  They are, I believe, pretty correct literary exercises, or will be, with a few filings; but they are not remarkable for white-hot vehemence of inspiration; tepid works! respectable versifications of very proper and even original sentiments: kind of Hayleyistic, I fear—but no, this is morbid self-depreciation.  The family is all very shaky in health, but our motto is now ‘Al Monte!’ in the words of Don Lope, in the play the sister and I are just beating through with two bad dictionaries and an insane grammar.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I to the hills.—Yours ever,</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR STODDARD,—I am guilty in thy sight and the sight of God.  However, I swore a great oath that you should see some of my manuscript at last; and though I have long delayed to keep it, yet it was to be.  You re-read your story and were disgusted; that is the cold fit following the hot.  I don’t say you did wrong to be disgusted, yet I am sure you did wrong to be disgusted altogether.  There was, you may depend upon it, some reason for your previous vanity, as well as your present mortification.  I shall hear you, years from now, timidly begin to retrim your feathers for a little self-laudation, and trot out this misdespised novelette as not the worst of your performances.  I read the album extracts with sincere interest; but I regret that you spared to give the paper more development; and I conceive that you might do a great deal worse than expand each of its paragraphs into an essay or sketch, the excuse being in each case your personal intercourse; the bulk, when that would not be sufficient, to be made up from their own works and stories.  Three at least—Menken, Yelverton, and Keeler—could not fail of a vivid human interest.  Let me press upon you this plan; should any document be wanted from Europe, let me offer my services to procure it.  I am persuaded that there is stuff in the idea.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Are you coming over again to see me some day soon?  I keep returning, and now hand over fist, from the realms of Hades: I saw that gentleman between the eyes, and fear him less after each visit.  Only Charon, and his rough boatmanship, I somewhat fear.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I have a desire to write some verses for your album; so, if you will give me the entry among your gods, goddesses, and godlets, there will be nothing wanting but the Muse.  I think of the verses like Mark Twain; sometimes I wish fulsomely to belaud you; sometimes to insult your city and fellow-citizens; sometimes to sit down quietly, with the slender reed, and troll a few staves of Panic ecstasy—but fy! fy! as my ancestors observed, the last is too easy for a man of my feet and inches.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">At least, Stoddard, you now see that, although so costive, when I once begin I am a copious letter-writer.  I thank you, and <hi rend="italic">au revoir</hi>.</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR COLVIN,—It is a long while since I have heard from you; nearly a month, I believe; and I begin to grow very uneasy.  At first I was tempted to suppose that I had been myself to blame in some way; but now I have grown to fear lest some sickness or trouble among those whom you love may not be the impediment.  I believe I shall soon hear; so I wait as best I can.  I am, beyond a doubt, greatly stronger, and yet still useless for any work, and, I may say, for any pleasure.  My affairs and the bad weather still keep me here unmarried; but not, I earnestly hope, for long.  Whenever I get into the mountain, I trust I shall rapidly pick up.  Until I get away from these sea fogs and my imprisonment in the house, I do not hope to do much more than keep from active harm.  My doctor took a desponding fit about me, and scared Fanny into blue fits; but I have talked her over again.  It is the change I want, and the blessed sun, and a gentle air in which I can sit out and see the trees and running water: these mere defensive hygienics cannot advance one, though they may prevent evil.  I do nothing now, but try to possess my soul in peace, and continue to possess my body on any terms.</p>

                     <p rend="justify">All which is a fortnight old and not much to the point nowadays.  Here we are, Fanny and I, and a certain hound, in a lovely valley under Mount Saint Helena, looking around, or rather wondering when we shall begin to look around, for a house of our own.  I have received the first sheets of the <hi rend="italic">Amateur Emigrant</hi>; not yet the second bunch, as announced.  It is a pretty heavy, emphatic piece of pedantry; but I don’t care; the public, I verily believe, will like it.  I have excised all you proposed and more on my own movement.  But I have not yet been able to rewrite the two special pieces which, as you said, so badly wanted it; it is hard work to rewrite passages in proof; and the easiest work is still hard to me.  But I am certainly recovering fast; a married and convalescent being.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Received James’s <hi rend="italic">Hawthorne</hi>, on which I meditate a blast, Miss Bird, Dixon’s <hi rend="italic">Penn</hi>, a <hi rend="italic">wrong Cornhill</hi> (like my luck) and <hi rend="italic">Coquelin</hi>: for all which, and especially the last, I tender my best thanks.  I have opened only James; it is very clever, very well written, and out of sight the most inside-out thing in the world; I have dug up the hatchet; a scalp shall flutter at my belt ere long.  I think my new book should be good; it will contain our adventures for the summer, so far as these are worth narrating; and I have already a few pages of diary which should make up bright.  I am going to repeat my old experiment, after buckling-to a while to write more correctly, lie down and have a wallow.  Whether I shall get any of my novels done this summer I do not know; I wish to finish the <hi rend="italic">Vendetta</hi> first, for it really could not come after <hi rend="italic">Prince Otto</hi>.  Lewis Campbell has made some noble work in that Agamemnon; it surprised me.  We hope to get a house at Silverado, a deserted mining-camp eight miles up the mountain, now solely inhabited by a mighty hunter answering to the name of Rufe Hansome, who slew last year a hundred and fifty deer.  This is the motto I propose for the new volume: ‘<hi rend="italic">Vixerunt nonnulli in agris</hi>, <hi rend="italic">delectati re sua familiari</hi>.  <hi rend="italic">His idem propositum fuit quod regibus</hi>, <hi rend="italic">ut ne qua re egerent</hi>, <hi rend="italic">ne cui parerent</hi>, <hi rend="italic">libertate uterentur</hi>; <hi rend="italic">cujus proprium est sic vivere ut velis</hi>.’  I always have a terror lest the wish should have been father to the translation, when I come to quote; but that seems too plain sailing.  I should put <hi rend="italic">regibus</hi> in capitals for the pleasantry’s sake.  We are in the Coast Range, that being so much cheaper to reach; the family, I hope, will soon follow.—Love to all, ever yours,</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR WEG,—I have many letters that I ought to write in preference to this; but a duty to letters and to you prevails over any private consideration.  You are going to collect odes; I could not wish a better man to do so; but I tremble lest you should commit two sins of omission.  You will not, I am sure, be so far left to yourself as to give us no more of Dryden than the hackneyed St. Cecilia; I know you will give us some others of those surprising masterpieces where there is more sustained eloquence and harmony of English numbers than in all that has been written since; there is a machine about a poetical young lady, and another about either Charles or James, I know not which; and they are both indescribably fine.  (Is Marvell’s Horatian Ode good enough?  I half think so.)  But my great point is a fear that you are one of those who are unjust to our old Tennyson’s Duke of Wellington.  I have just been talking it over with Symonds; and we agreed that whether for its metrical effects, for its brief, plain, stirring words of portraiture, as—he ‘that never lost an English gun,’ or—the soldier salute; or for the heroic apostrophe to Nelson; that ode has never been surpassed in any tongue or time.  Grant me the Duke, O Weg!  I suppose you must not put in yours about the warship; you will have to admit worse ones, however.—Ever yours,</p>

                     <p rend="justify">This letter is a report of a long sederunt, also steterunt in small committee at Davos Platz, Dec. 15, 1880.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Its results are unhesitatingly shot at your head.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR WEG,—We both insist on the Duke of Wellington.  Really it cannot be left out.  Symonds said you would cover yourself with shame, and I add, your friends with confusion, if you leave it out.  Really, you know it is the only thing you have, since Dryden, where that irregular odic, odal, odous (?) verse is used with mastery and sense.  And it’s one of our few English blood-boilers.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">(2) Byron: if anything: <hi rend="italic">Prometheus</hi>.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">(3) Shelley (1) <hi rend="italic">The world’s great age</hi> from Hellas; we are both dead on.  After that you have, of course, <hi rend="italic">The West Wind</hi> thing.  But we think (1) would maybe be enough; no more than two any way.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">(4) Herrick.  <hi rend="italic">Meddowes</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Come</hi>, <hi rend="italic">my Corinna</hi>.  After that <hi rend="italic">Mr. Wickes</hi>: two any way.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">(5) Leave out stanza 3rd of Congreve’s thing, like a dear; we can’t stand the ‘sigh’ nor the ‘peruke.’</p>
                     <p rend="justify">(6) Milton.  <hi rend="italic">Time</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Solemn Music</hi>.  We both agree we would rather go without L’Allegro and Il Penseroso than these; for the reason that these are not so well known to the brutish herd.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">(7) Is the <hi rend="italic">Royal George</hi> an ode, or only an elegy?  It’s so good.</p>

                     <p rend="justify">(9) If you take anything from Clough, but we don’t either of us fancy you will, let it be <hi rend="italic">Come back</hi>.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">(10) Quite right about Dryden.  I had a hankering after <hi rend="italic">Threnodia Augustalis</hi>; but I find it long and with very prosaic holes: though, O! what fine stuff between whiles.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">(11) Right with Collins.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">(12) Right about Pope’s Ode.  But what can you give?  <hi rend="italic">The Dying Christian</hi>? or one of his inimitable courtesies?  These last are fairly odes, by the Horatian model, just as my dear <hi rend="italic">Meddowes</hi> is an ode in the name and for the sake of Bandusia.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">(13) Whatever you do, you’ll give us the Greek Vase.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">(14) Do you like Jonson’s ‘loathèd stage’?  Verses 2, 3, and 4 are so bad, also the last line.  But there is a fine movement and feeling in the rest.</p>

                     <p rend="justify">DEAR CHARLES WARREN STODDARD,—Many thanks to you for the letter and the photograph.  Will you think it mean if I ask you to wait till there appears a promised cheap edition?  Possibly the canny Scot does feel pleasure in the superior cheapness; but the true reason is this, that I think to put a few words, by way of notes, to each book in its new form, because that will be the Standard Edition, without which no g.’s l. <ref target="#1730040348670317495_622-h-3.htm.xhtml#footnote191">[191]</ref> will be complete.  The edition, briefly, <hi rend="italic">sine qua non</hi>.  Before that, I shall hope to send you my essays, which are in the printer’s hands.  I look to get yours soon.  I am sorry to hear that the Custom House has proved fallible, like all other human houses and customs.  Life consists of that sort of business, and I fear that there is a class of man, of which you offer no inapt type, doomed to a kind of mild, general disappointment through life.  I do not believe that a man is the more unhappy for that.  Disappointment, except with one’s self, is not a very capital affair; and the sham beatitude, ‘Blessed is he that expecteth little,’ one of the truest, and in a sense, the most Christlike things in literature.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Alongside of you, I have been all my days a red cannon ball of dissipated effort; here I am by the heels in this Alpine valley, with just so much of a prospect of future restoration as shall make my present caged estate easily tolerable to me—shall or should, I would not swear to the word before the trial’s done.  I miss all my objects in the meantime; and, thank God, I have enough of my old, and maybe somewhat base philosophy, to keep me on a good understanding with myself and Providence.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">The mere extent of a man’s travels has in it something consolatory.  That he should have left friends and enemies in many different and distant quarters gives a sort of earthly dignity to his existence.  And I think the better of myself for the belief that I have left some in California interested in me and my successes.  Let me assure you, you who have made friends already among such various and distant races, that there is a certain phthisical Scot who will always be pleased to hear good news of you, and would be better pleased by nothing than to learn that you had thrown off your present incubus, largely consisting of letters I believe, and had sailed into some square work by way of change.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">And by way of change in itself, let me copy on the other pages some broad Scotch I wrote for you when I was ill last spring in Oakland.  It is no muckle worth: but ye should na look a gien horse in the moo’.—Yours ever,</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR PEOPLE,—I do not understand these reproaches.  The letters come between seven and nine in the evening; and every one about the books was answered that same night, and the answer left Davos by seven o’clock next morning.  Perhaps the snow delayed then; if so, ’tis a good hint to you not to be uneasy at apparent silences.  There is no hurry about my father’s notes; I shall not be writing anything till I get home again, I believe.  Only I want to be able to keep reading <hi rend="italic">ad hoc</hi> all winter, as it seems about all I shall be fit for.  About John Brown, I have been breaking my heart to finish a Scotch poem to him.  Some of it is not really bad, but the rest will not come, and I mean to get it right before I do anything else.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">The bazaar is over, £160 gained, and everybody’s health lost: altogether, I never had a more uncomfortable time; apply to Fanny for further details of the discomfort.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">We have our Wogg in somewhat better trim now, and vastly better spirits.  The weather has been bad—for Davos, but indeed it is a wonderful climate.  It never feels cold; yesterday, with a little, chill, small, northerly draught, for the first time, it was pinching.  Usually, it may freeze, or snow, or do what it pleases, you feel it not, or hardly any.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Thanks for your notes; that fishery question will come in, as you notice, in the Highland Book, as well as under the Union; it is very important.  I hear no word of Hugh Miller’s <hi rend="italic">Evictions</hi>; I count on that.  What you say about the old and new Statistical is odd.  It seems to me very much as if I were gingerly embarking on a <hi rend="italic">History of Modern Scotland</hi>.  Probably Tulloch will never carry it out.  And, you see, once I have studied and written these two vols., <hi rend="italic">The Transformation of the Scottish</hi> 
                        <hi rend="italic">Highlands</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Scotland and the Union</hi>, I shall have a good ground to go upon.  The effect on my mind of what I have read has been to awaken a livelier sympathy for the Irish; although they never had the remarkable virtues, I fear they have suffered many of the injustices, of the Scottish Highlanders.  Ruedi has seen me this morning; he says the disease is at a standstill, and I am to profit by it to take more exercise.  Altogether, he seemed quite hopeful and pleased.—I am your ever affectionate son,</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR COLVIN,—Thanks for yours; I waited, as said I would.  I now expect no answer from you, regarding you as a mere dumb cock-shy, or a target, at which we fire our arrows diligently all day long, with no anticipation it will bring them back to us.  We are both sadly mortified you are not coming, but health comes first; alas, that man should be so crazy.  What fun we could have, if we were all well, what work we could do, what a happy place we could make it for each other!  If I were able to do what I want; but then I am not, and may leave that vein.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">No.  I do not think I shall require to know the Gaelic; few things are written in that language, or ever were; if you come to that, the number of those who could write, or even read it, through almost all my period, must, by all accounts, have been incredibly small.  Of course, until the book is done, I must live as much as possible in the Highlands, and that suits my book as to health.  It is a most interesting and sad story, and from the ’45 it is all to be written for the first time.  This, of course, will cause me a far greater difficulty about authorities; but I have already learned much, and where to look for more.  One pleasant feature is the vast number of delightful writers I shall have to deal with: Burt, Johnson, Boswell, Mrs. Grant of Laggan, Scott.  There will be interesting sections on the Ossianic controversy and the growth of the taste for Highland scenery.  I have to touch upon Rob Roy, Flora Macdonald, the strange story of Lady Grange, the beautiful story of the tenants on the Forfeited Estates, and the odd, inhuman problem of the great evictions.  The religious conditions are wild, unknown, very surprising.  And three out of my five parts remain hitherto entirely unwritten.  Smack!—Yours ever,</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR MOTHER,—I was very tired yesterday and could not write; tobogganed so furiously all morning; we had a delightful day, crowned by an incredible dinner—more courses than I have fingers on my hands.  Your letter arrived duly at night, and I thank you for it as I should.  You need not suppose I am at all insensible to my father’s extraordinary kindness about this book; he is a brick; I vote for him freely.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">. . . The assurance you speak of is what we all ought to have, and might have, and should not consent to live without.  That people do not have it more than they do is, I believe, because persons speak so much in large-drawn, theological similitudes, and won’t say out what they mean about life, and man, and God, in fair and square human language.  I wonder if you or my father ever thought of the obscurities that lie upon human duty from the negative form in which the Ten Commandments are stated, or of how Christ was so continually substituting affirmations.  ‘Thou shalt not’ is but an example; ‘Thou shalt’ is the law of God.  It was this that seems meant in the phrase that ‘not one jot nor tittle of the law should pass.’  But what led me to the remark is this: A kind of black, angry look goes with that statement of the law of negatives.  ‘To love one’s neighbour as oneself’ is certainly much harder, but states life so much more actively, gladly, and kindly, that you begin to see some pleasure in it; and till you can see pleasure in these hard choices and bitter necessities, where is there any Good News to men?  It is much more important to do right than not to do wrong; further, the one is possible, the other has always been and will ever be impossible; and the faithful <hi rend="italic">design to do right</hi> is accepted by God; that seems to me to be the Gospel, and that was how Christ delivered us from the Law.  After people are told that, surely they might hear more encouraging sermons.  To blow the trumpet for good would seem the Parson’s business; and since it is not in our own strength, but by faith and perseverance (no account made of slips), that we are to run the race, I do not see where they get the material for their gloomy discourses.  Faith is not to believe the Bible, but to believe in God; if you believe in God (or, for it’s the same thing, have that assurance you speak about), where is there any more room for terror?  There are only three possible attitudes—Optimism, which has gone to smash; Pessimism, which is on the rising hand, and very popular with many clergymen who seem to think they are Christians.  And this Faith, which is the Gospel.  Once you hold the last, it is your business (1) to find out what is right in any given case, and (2) to try to do it; if you fail in the last, that is by commission, Christ tells you to hope; if you fail in the first, that is by omission, his picture of the last day gives you but a black lookout.  The whole necessary morality is kindness; and it should spring, of itself, from the one fundamental doctrine, Faith.  If you are sure that God, in the long run, means kindness by you, you should be happy; and if happy, surely you should be kind.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I beg your pardon for this long discourse; it is not all right, of course, but I am sure there is something in it.  One thing I have not got clearly; that about the omission and the commission; but there is truth somewhere about it, and I have no time to clear it just now.  Do you know, you have had about a Cornhill page of sermon?  It is, however, true.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Lloyd heard with dismay Fanny was not going to give me a present; so F. and I had to go and buy things for ourselves, and go through a representation of surprise when they were presented next morning.  It gave us both quite a Santa Claus feeling on Xmas Eve to see him so excited and hopeful; I enjoyed it hugely.—Your affectionate son,</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR COLVIN.—My health is not just what it should be; I have lost weight, pulse, respiration, etc., and gained nothing in the way of my old bellows.  But these last few days, with tonic, cod-liver oil, better wine (there is some better now), and perpetual beef-tea, I think I have progressed.  To say truth, I have been here a little over long.  I was reckoning up, and since I have known you, already quite a while, I have not, I believe, remained so long in any one place as here in Davos.  That tells on my old gipsy nature; like a violin hung up, I begin to lose what music there was in me; and with the music, I do not know what besides, or do not know what to call it, but something radically part of life, a rhythm, perhaps, in one’s old and so brutally over-ridden nerves, or perhaps a kind of variety of blood that the heart has come to look for.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I purposely knocked myself off first.  As to F. A. S., I believe I am no sound authority; I alternate between a stiff disregard and a kind of horror.  In neither mood can a man judge at all.  I know the thing to be terribly perilous, I fear it to be now altogether hopeless.  Luck has failed; the weather has not been favourable; and in her true heart, the mother hopes no more.  But—well, I feel a great deal, that I either cannot or will not say, as you well know.  It has helped to make me more conscious of the wolverine on my own shoulders, and that also makes me a poor judge and poor adviser.  Perhaps, if we were all marched out in a row, and a piece of platoon firing to the drums performed, it would be well for us; although, I suppose—and yet I wonder!—so ill for the poor mother and for the dear wife.  But you can see this makes me morbid.  <hi rend="italic">Sufficit</hi>; <hi rend="italic">explicit</hi>.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">You are right about the Carlyle book; F. and I are in a world not ours; but pardon me, as far as sending on goes, we take another view: the first volume, <hi rend="italic">à la bonne</hi> 
                        <hi rend="italic">heure</hi>! but not—never—the second.  Two hours of hysterics can be no good matter for a sick nurse, and the strange, hard, old being in so lamentable and yet human a desolation—crying out like a burnt child, and yet always wisely and beautifully—how can that end, as a piece of reading, even to the strong—but on the brink of the most cruel kind of weeping?  I observe the old man’s style is stronger on me than ever it was, and by rights, too, since I have just laid down his most attaching book.  God rest the baith o’ them!  But even if they do not meet again, how we should all be strengthened to be kind, and not only in act, in speech also, that so much more important part.  See what this apostle of silence most regrets, not speaking out his heart.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I was struck as you were by the admirable, sudden, clear sunshine upon Southey—even on his works.  Symonds, to whom I repeated it, remarked at once, a man who was thus respected by both Carlyle and Landor must have had more in him than we can trace.  So I feel with true humility.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">It was to save my brain that Symonds proposed reviewing.  He and, it appears, Leslie Stephen fear a little some eclipse; I am not quite without sharing the fear.  I know my own languor as no one else does; it is a dead down-draught, a heavy fardel.  Yet if I could shake off the wolverine aforesaid, and his fangs are lighter, though perhaps I feel them more, I believe I could be myself again a while.  I have not written any letter for a great time; none saying what I feel, since you were here, I fancy.  Be duly obliged for it, and take my most earnest thanks not only for the books but for your letter.  Your affectionate,</p>
                     <p rend="justify">R. L. S.</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR WEG,—Here I am in my native land, being gently blown and hailed upon, and sitting nearer and nearer to the fire.  A cottage near a moor is soon to receive our human forms; it is also near a burn to which Professor Blackie (no less!) has written some verses in his hot old age, and near a farm from whence we shall draw cream and fatness.  Should I be moved to join Blackie, I shall go upon my knees and pray hard against temptation; although, since the new Version, I do not know the proper form of words.  The swollen, childish, and pedantic vanity that moved the said revisers to put ‘bring’ for ‘lead,’ is a sort of literary fault that calls for an eternal hell; it may be quite a small place, a star of the least magnitude, and shabbily furnished; there shall —, —, the revisers of the Bible and other absolutely loathsome literary lepers, dwell among broken pens, bad, <hi rend="italic">groundy</hi> ink and ruled blotting-paper made in France—all eagerly burning to write, and all inflicted with incurable aphasia.  I should not have thought upon that torture had I not suffered it in moderation myself, but it is too horrid even for a hell; let’s let ’em off with an eternal toothache.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">All this talk is partly to persuade you that I write to you out of good feeling only, which is not the case.  I am a beggar: ask Dobson, Saintsbury, yourself, and any other of these cheeses who know something of the eighteenth century, what became of Jean Cavalier between his coming to England and his death in 1740.  Is anything interesting known about him?  Whom did he marry?  The happy French, smilingly following one another in a long procession headed by the loud and empty Napoleon Peyrat, say, Olympe Dunoyer, Voltaire’s old flame.  Vacquerie even thinks that they were rivals, and is very French and very literary and very silly in his comments.  Now I may almost say it consists with my knowledge that all this has not a shadow to rest upon.  It is very odd and very annoying; I have splendid materials for Cavalier till he comes to my own country; and there, though he continues to advance in the service, he becomes entirely invisible to me.  Any information about him will be greatly welcome: I may mention that I know as much as I desire about the other prophets, Marion, Fage, Cavalier (de Sonne), my Cavalier’s cousin, the unhappy Lions, and the idiotic Mr. Lacy; so if any erudite starts upon that track, you may choke him off.  If you can find aught for me, or if you will but try, count on my undying gratitude.  Lang’s ‘Library’ is very pleasant reading.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">My book will reach you soon, for I write about it to-day—Yours ever,</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR MACKAY,—What is this I hear?—that you are retiring from your chair.  It is not, I hope, from ill-health?</p>
                     <p rend="justify">But if you are retiring, may I ask if you have promised your support to any successor?  I have a great mind to try.  The summer session would suit me; the chair would suit me—if only I would suit it; I certainly should work it hard: that I can promise.  I only wish it were a few years from now, when I hope to have something more substantial to show for myself.  Up to the present time, all that I have published, even bordering on history, has been in an occasional form, and I fear this is much against me.</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR MACKAY,—Thank you very much for your kind letter, and still more for your good opinion.  You are not the only one who has regretted my absence from your lectures; but you were to me, then, only a part of a mangle through which I was being slowly and unwillingly dragged—part of a course which I had not chosen—part, in a word, of an organised boredom.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I am glad to have your reasons for giving up the chair; they are partly pleasant, and partly honourable to you.  And I think one may say that every man who publicly declines a plurality of offices, makes it perceptibly more difficult for the next man to accept them.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Every one tells me that I come too late upon the field, every one being pledged, which, seeing it is yet too early for any one to come upon the field, I must regard as a polite evasion.  Yet all advise me to stand, as it might serve me against the next vacancy.  So stand I shall, unless things are changed.  As it is, with my health this summer class is a great attraction; it is perhaps the only hope I may have of a permanent income.  I had supposed the needs of the chair might be met by choosing every year some period of history in which questions of Constitutional Law were involved; but this is to look too far forward.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I understand (1<hi rend="italic">st</hi>) that no overt steps can be taken till your resignation is accepted; and (2<hi rend="italic">nd</hi>) that in the meantime I may, without offence, mention my design to stand.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">If I am mistaken about these, please correct me, as I do not wish to appear where I should not.</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR GOSSE,—I wonder if I misdirected my last to you.  I begin to fear it.  I hope, however, this will go right.  I am in act to do a mad thing—to stand for the Edinburgh Chair of History; it is elected for by the advocates, <hi rend="italic">quorum pars</hi>; I am told that I am too late this year; but advised on all hands to go on, as it is likely soon to be once more vacant; and I shall have done myself good for the next time.  Now, if I got the thing (which I cannot, it appears), I believe, in spite of all my imperfections, I could be decently effectual.  If you can think so also, do put it in a testimonial.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Heavens!  <hi rend="italic">Je me sauve</hi>, I have something else to say to you, but after that (which is not a joke) I shall keep it for another shoot.—Yours testimonially,</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR WEG,—Many thanks for the testimonial; many thanks for your blind, wondering letter; many wishes, lastly, for your swift recovery.  Insomnia is the opposite pole from my complaint; which brings with it a nervous lethargy, an unkind, unwholesome, and ungentle somnolence, fruitful in heavy heads and heavy eyes at morning.  You cannot sleep; well, I can best explain my state thus: I cannot wake.  Sleep, like the lees of a posset, lingers all day, lead-heavy, in my knees and ankles.  Weight on the shoulders, torpor on the brain.  And there is more than too much of that from an ungrateful hound who is now enjoying his first decently competent and peaceful weeks for close upon two years; happy in a big brown moor behind him, and an incomparable burn by his side; happy, above all, in some work—for at last I am at work with that appetite and confidence that alone makes work supportable.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I told you I had something else to say.  I am very tedious—it is another request.  In August and a good part of September we shall be in Braemar, in a house with some accommodation.  Now Braemar is a place patronised by the royalty of the Sister Kingdoms—Victoria and the Cairngorms, sir, honouring that countryside by their conjunct presence.  This seems to me the spot for A Bard.  Now can you come to see us for a little while?  I can promise you, you must like my father, because you are a human being; you ought to like Braemar, because of your avocation; and you ought to like me, because I like you; and again, you must like my wife, because she likes cats; and as for my mother—well, come and see, what do you think? that is best.  Mrs. Gosse, my wife tells me, will have other fish to fry; and to be plain, I should not like to ask her till I had seen the house.  But a lone man I know we shall be equal to.  <hi rend="italic">Qu’en dis tu</hi>?  <hi rend="italic">Viens</hi>.—Yours,</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR MR. HAMMERTON,—(There goes the second M.; it is a certainty.)  Thank you for your prompt and kind answer, little as I deserved it, though I hope to show you I was less undeserving than I seemed.  But just might I delete two words in your testimonial?  The two words ‘and legal’ were unfortunately winged by chance against my weakest spot, and would go far to damn me.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">It was not my bliss that I was interested in when I was married; it was a sort of marriage <hi rend="italic">in extremis</hi>; and if I am where I am, it is thanks to the care of that lady who married me when I was a mere complication of cough and bones, much fitter for an emblem of mortality than a bridegroom.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I had a fair experience of that kind of illness when all the women (God bless them!) turn round upon the streets and look after you with a look that is only too kind not to be cruel.  I have had nearly two years of more or less prostration.  I have done no work whatever since the February before last until quite of late.  To be precise, until the beginning of last month, exactly two essays.  All last winter I was at Davos; and indeed I am home here just now against the doctor’s orders, and must soon be back again to that unkindly haunt ‘upon the mountains visitant’—there goes no angel there but the angel of death. <ref target="#1730040348670317495_622-h-3.htm.xhtml#footnote209">[209]</ref>  The deaths of last winter are still sore spots to me. . . . So, you see, I am not very likely to go on a ‘wild expedition,’ cis-Stygian at least.  The truth is, I am scarce justified in standing for the chair, though I hope you will not mention this; and yet my health is one of my reasons, for the class is in summer.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I hope this statement of my case will make my long neglect appear less unkind.  It was certainly not because I ever forgot you, or your unwonted kindness; and it was not because I was in any sense rioting in pleasures.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I am glad to hear the catamaran is on her legs again; you have my warmest wishes for a good cruise down the Saône; and yet there comes some envy to that wish, for when shall I go cruising?  Here a sheer hulk, alas! lies R. L. S.  But I will continue to hope for a better time, canoes that will sail better to the wind, and a river grander than the Saône.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I heard, by the way, in a letter of counsel from a well-wisher, one reason of my town’s absurdity about the chair of Art: I fear it is characteristic of her manners.  It was because you did not call upon the electors!</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR COLVIN,—I do believe I am better, mind and body; I am tired just now, for I have just been up the burn with Wogg, daily growing better and boo’f’ler; so do not judge my state by my style in this.  I am working steady, four Cornhill pages scrolled every day, besides the correspondence about this chair, which is heavy in itself.  My first story, ‘Thrawn Janet,’ all in Scotch, is accepted by Stephen; my second, ‘The Body Snatchers,’ is laid aside in a justifiable disgust, the tale being horrid; my third, ‘The Merry Men,’ I am more than half through, and think real well of.  It is a fantastic sonata about the sea and wrecks; and I like it much above all my other attempts at story-telling; I think it is strange; if ever I shall make a hit, I have the line now, as I believe.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Fanny has finished one of hers, ‘The Shadow on the Bed,’ and is now hammering at a second, for which we have ‘no name’ as yet—not by Wilkie Collins.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">Tales for Winter Nights</hi>.  Yes, that, I think, we will call the lot of them when republished.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Why have you not sent me a testimonial?  Everybody else but you has responded, and Symonds, but I’m afraid he’s ill.  Do think, too, if anybody else would write me a testimonial.  I am told quantity goes far.  I have good ones from Rev. Professor Campbell, Professor Meiklejohn, Leslie Stephen, Lang, Gosse, and a very shaky one from Hamerton.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Grant is an elector, so can’t, but has written me kindly.  From Tulloch I have not yet heard.  Do help me with suggestions.  This old chair, with its £250 and its light work, would make me.</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR HENLEY,—I hope, then, to have a visit from you.  If before August, here; if later, at Braemar.  Tupe!</p>
                     <p rend="justify">And now, <hi rend="italic">mon bon</hi>, I must babble about ‘The Merry Men,’ my favourite work.  It is a fantastic sonata about the sea and wrecks.  Chapter I. ‘Eilean Aros’—the island, the roost, the ‘merry men,’ the three people there living—sea superstitions.  Chapter II. ‘What the Wreck had brought to Aros.’  Eh, boy? what had it?  Silver and clocks and brocades, and what a conscience, what a mad brain!  Chapter III. ‘Past and Present in Sandag Bay’—the new wreck and the old—so old—the Armada treasure-ship, Santma Trinid—the grave in the heather—strangers there.  Chapter IV. ‘The Gale’—the doomed ship—the storm—the drunken madman on the head—cries in the night.  Chapter V. ‘A Man out of the Sea.’  But I must not breathe to you my plot.  It is, I fancy, my first real shoot at a story; an odd thing, sir, but, I believe, my own, though there is a little of Scott’s <hi rend="italic">Pirate</hi> in it, as how should there not?  He had the root of romance in such places.  Aros is Earraid, where I lived lang syne; the Ross of Grisapol is the Ross of Mull; Ben Ryan, Ben More.  I have written to the middle of Chapter IV.  Like enough, when it is finished I shall discard all chapterings; for the thing is written straight through.  It must, unhappily, be re-written—too well written not to be.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">The chair is only three months in summer; that is why I try for it.  If I get it, which I shall not, I should be independent at once.  Sweet thought.  I liked your Byron well; your Berlioz better.  No one would remark these cuts; even I, who was looking for it, knew it not at all to be a <hi rend="italic">torso</hi>.  The paper strengthens me in my recommendation to you to follow Colvin’s hint.  Give us an 1830; you will do it well, and the subject smiles widely on the world:—</p>
                     <p rend="justify">1830: <hi rend="italic">A Chapter of Artistic History</hi>, by William Ernest Henley (or <hi rend="italic">of Social and Artistic History</hi>, as the thing might grow to you).  Sir, you might be in the Athenæum yet with that; and, believe me, you might and would be far better, the author of a readable book.—Yours ever,</p>

                     <p rend="justify">DEAR HENLEY,—To answer a point or two.  First, the Spanish ship was sloop-rigged and clumsy, because she was fitted out by some private adventurers, not over wealthy, and glad to take what they could get.  Is that not right?  Tell me if you think not.  That, at least, was how I meant it.  As for the boat-cloaks, I am afraid they are, as you say, false imagination; but I love the name, nature, and being of them so dearly, that I feel as if I would almost rather ruin a story than omit the reference.  The proudest moments of my life have been passed in the stern-sheets of a boat with that romantic garment over my shoulders.  This, without prejudice to one glorious day when standing upon some water stairs at Lerwick I signalled with my pocket-handkerchief for a boat to come ashore for me.  I was then aged fifteen or sixteen; conceive my glory.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Several of the phrases you object to are proper nautical, or long-shore phrases, and therefore, I think, not out of place in this long-shore story.  As for the two members which you thought at first so ill-united; I confess they seem perfectly so to me.  I have chosen to sacrifice a long-projected story of adventure because the sentiment of that is identical with the sentiment of ‘My uncle.’  My uncle himself is not the story as I see it, only the leading episode of that story.  It’s really a story of wrecks, as they appear to the dweller on the coast.  It’s a view of the sea.  Goodness knows when I shall be able to re-write; I must first get over this copper-headed cold.</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR COLVIN,—This is the first letter I have written this good while.  I have had a brutal cold, not perhaps very wisely treated; lots of blood—for me, I mean.  I was so well, however, before, that I seem to be sailing through with it splendidly.  My appetite never failed; indeed, as I got worse, it sharpened—a sort of reparatory instinct.  Now I feel in a fair way to get round soon.</p>
                     <p rend="justify"> </p>

                        <hi rend="italic">Monday</hi>, <hi rend="italic">August</hi> (2<hi rend="italic">nd</hi>, is it?).—We set out for the Spital of Glenshee, and reach Braemar on Tuesday.  The Braemar address we cannot learn; it looks as if ‘Braemar’ were all that was necessary; if particular, you can address 17 Heriot Row.  We shall be delighted to see you whenever, and as soon as ever, you can make it possible.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">. . . I hope heartily you will survive me, and do not doubt it.  There are seven or eight people it is no part of my scheme in life to survive—yet if I could but heal me of my bellowses, I could have a jolly life—have it, even now, when I can work and stroll a little, as I have been doing till this cold.  I have so many things to make life sweet to me, it seems a pity I cannot have that other one thing—health.  But though you will be angry to hear it, I believe, for myself at least, what is is best.  I believed it all through my worst days, and I am not ashamed to profess it now.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Landor has just turned up; but I had read him already.  I like him extremely; I wonder if the ‘cuts’ were perhaps not advantageous.  It seems quite full enough; but then you know I am a compressionist.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">If I am to criticise, it is a little staid; but the classical is apt to look so.  It is in curious contrast to that inexpressive, unplanned wilderness of Forster’s; clear, readable, precise, and sufficiently human.  I see nothing lost in it, though I could have wished, in my Scotch capacity, a trifle clearer and fuller exposition of his moral attitude, which is not quite clear ‘from here.’</p>
                     <p rend="justify">He and his tyrannicide!  I am in a mad fury about these explosions.  If that is the new world!  Damn O’Donovan Rossa; damn him behind and before, above, below, and roundabout; damn, deracinate, and destroy him, root and branch, self and company, world without end.  Amen.  I write that for sport if you like, but I will pray in earnest, O Lord, if you cannot convert, kindly delete him!</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Stories naturally at—halt.  Henley has seen one and approves.  I believe it to be good myself, even real good.  He has also seen and approved one of Fanny’s.  It will snake a good volume.  We have now</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR SIR,—I should long ago have written to thank you for your kind and frank letter; but in my state of health papers are apt to get mislaid, and your letter has been vainly hunted for until this (Sunday) morning.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I regret I shall not be able to see you in Edinburgh; one visit to Edinburgh has already cost me too dear in that invaluable particular health; but if it should be at all possible for you to push on as far as Braemar, I believe you would find an attentive listener, and I can offer you a bed, a drive, and necessary food, etc.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">If, however, you should not be able to come thus far, I can promise you two things: First, I shall religiously revise what I have written, and bring out more clearly the point of view from which I regarded Thoreau; second, I shall in the Preface record your objection.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">The point of view (and I must ask you not to forget that any such short paper is essentially only a <hi rend="italic">section through</hi> a man) was this: I desired to look at the man through his books.  Thus, for instance, when I mentioned his return to the pencil-making, I did it only in passing (perhaps I was wrong), because it seemed to me not an illustration of his principles, but a brave departure from them.  Thousands of such there were I do not doubt; still, they might be hardly to my purpose, though, as you say so, some of them would be.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Our difference as to pity I suspect was a logomachy of my making.  No pitiful acts on his part would surprise me; I know he would be more pitiful in practice than most of the whiners; but the spirit of that practice would still seem to be unjustly described by the word pity.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">When I try to be measured, I find myself usually suspected of a sneaking unkindness for my subject; but you may be sure, sir, I would give up most other things to be so good a man as Thoreau.  Even my knowledge of him leads me thus far.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Should you find yourself able to push on to Braemar—it may even be on your way—believe me, your visit will be most welcome.  The weather is cruel, but the place is, as I dare say you know, the very ‘wale’ of Scotland—bar Tummelside.—Yours very sincerely,</p>

                     <p rend="justify">. . . Well, I have been pretty mean, but I have not yet got over my cold so completely as to have recovered much energy.  It is really extraordinary that I should have recovered as well as I have in this blighting weather; the wind pipes, the rain comes in squalls, great black clouds are continually overhead, and it is as cold as March.  The country is delightful, more cannot be said; it is very beautiful, a perfect joy when we get a blink of sun to see it in.  The Queen knows a thing or two, I perceive; she has picked out the finest habitable spot in Britain.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I have done no work, and scarce written a letter for three weeks, but I think I should soon begin again; my cough is now very trifling.  I eat well, and seem to have lost but I little flesh in the meanwhile.  I was <hi rend="italic">wonderfully</hi> well before I caught this horrid cold.  I never thought I should have been as well again; I really enjoyed life and work; and, of course, I now have a good hope that this may return.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I suppose you heard of our ghost stories.  They are somewhat delayed by my cold and a bad attack of laziness, embroidery, etc., under which Fanny had been some time prostrate.  It is horrid that we can get no better weather.  I did not get such good accounts of you as might have been.  You must imitate me.  I am now one of the most conscientious people at trying to get better you ever saw.  I have a white hat, it is much admired; also a plaid, and a heavy stoop; so I take my walks abroad, witching the world.</p>

C. inviting you to appear in sealskin.  But this had reference to the weather, and not at all, as you may have been led to fancy, to our rustic raiment of an evening.</p>

In short, let your own heart decide, and the capacity of your portmanteau.  If you came in camel’s hair, you would still, although conspicuous, be welcome.</p>

                     <p rend="justify">If this don’t fetch the kids, why, they have gone rotten since my day.  Will you be surprised to learn that it is about Buccaneers, that it begins in the <hi rend="italic">Admiral Benbow</hi> public-house on Devon coast, that it’s all about a map, and a treasure, and a mutiny, and a derelict ship, and a current, and a fine old Squire Trelawney (the real Tre, purged of literature and sin, to suit the infant mind), and a doctor, and another doctor, and a sea-cook with one leg, and a sea-song with the chorus ‘Yo-ho-ho-and a bottle of rum’ (at the third Ho you heave at the capstan bars), which is a real buccaneer’s song, only known to the crew of the late Captain Flint (died of rum at Key West, much regretted, friends will please accept this intimation); and lastly, would you be surprised to hear, in this connection, the name of <hi rend="italic">Routledge</hi>?  That’s the kind of man I am, blast your eyes.  Two chapters are written, and have been tried on Lloyd with great success; the trouble is to work it off without oaths.  Buccaneers without oaths—bricks without straw.  But youth and the fond parient have to be consulted.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">And now look here—this is next day—and three chapters are written and read.  (Chapter I. The Old Sea-dog at the <hi rend="italic">Admiral Benbow</hi>.  Chapter II. Black Dog appears and disappears.  Chapter III. The Black Spot)  All now heard by Lloyd, F., and my father and mother, with high approval.  It’s quite silly and horrid fun, and what I want is the <hi rend="italic">best</hi> book about the Buccaneers that can be had—the latter B’s above all, Blackbeard and sich, and get Nutt or Bain to send it skimming by the fastest post.  And now I know you’ll write to me, for ‘The Sea Cook’s’ sake.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Your ‘Admiral Guinea’ is curiously near my line, but of course I’m fooling; and your Admiral sounds like a shublime gent.  Stick to him like wax—he’ll do.  My Trelawney is, as I indicate, several thousand sea-miles off the lie of the original or your Admiral Guinea; and besides, I have no more about him yet but one mention of his name, and I think it likely he may turn yet farther from the model in the course of handling.  A chapter a day I mean to do; they are short; and perhaps in a month the ‘Sea Cook’ may to Routledge go, yo-ho-ho and a bottle of rum!  My Trelawney has a strong dash of Landor, as I see him from here.  No women in the story, Lloyd’s orders; and who so blithe to obey?  It’s awful fun boys’ stories; you just indulge the pleasure of your heart, that’s all; no trouble, no strain.  The only stiff thing is to get it ended—that I don’t see, but I look to a volcano.  O sweet, O generous, O human toils.  You would like my blind beggar in Chapter III. I believe; no writing, just drive along as the words come and the pen will scratch!</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR DR. JAPP,—My father has gone, but I think may take it upon me to ask you to keep the book.  Of all things you could do to endear yourself to me, you have done the best, for my father and you have taken a fancy to each other.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I do not know how to thank you for all your kind trouble in the matter of ‘The Sea-Cook,’ but I am not unmindful.  My health is still poorly, and I have added intercostal rheumatism—a new attraction—which sewed me up nearly double for two days, and still gives me a list to starboard—let us be ever nautical!</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I do not think with the start I have there will be any difficulty in letting Mr. Henderson go ahead whenever he likes.  I will write my story up to its legitimate conclusion; and then we shall be in a position to judge whether a sequel would be desirable, and I would then myself know better about its practicability from the story-teller’s point of view.—Yours ever very sincerely,</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR HENLEY,—Thanks for your last.  The £100 fell through, or dwindled at least into somewhere about £30.  However, that I’ve taken as a mouthful, so you may look out for ‘The Sea Cook, or Treasure Island: A Tale of the Buccaneers,’ in <hi rend="italic">Young Folks</hi>.  (The terms are £2, 10s. a page of 4500 words; that’s not noble, is it?  But I have my copyright safe.  I don’t get illustrated—a blessing; that’s the price I have to pay for my copyright.)</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I’ll make this boys’ book business pay; but I have to make a beginning.  When I’m done with <hi rend="italic">Young Folks</hi>, I’ll try Routledge or some one.  I feel pretty sure the ‘Sea Cook’ will do to reprint, and bring something decent at that.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Japp is a good soul.  The poet was very gay and pleasant.  He told me much: he is simply the most active young man in England, and one of the most intelligent.  ‘He shall o’er Europe, shall o’er earth extend.’ <ref target="#1730040348670317495_622-h-3.htm.xhtml#footnote223">[223]</ref>  He is now extending over adjacent parts of Scotland.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I propose to follow up the ‘Sea Cook’ at proper intervals by ‘Jerry Abershaw: A Tale of Putney Heath’ (which or its site I must visit), ‘The Leading Light: A Tale of the Coast,’ ‘The Squaw Men: or the Wild West,’ and other instructive and entertaining work.  ‘Jerry Abershaw’ should be good, eh?  I love writing boys’ books.  This first is only an experiment; wait till you see what I can make ’em with my hand in.  I’ll be the Harrison Ainsworth of the future; and a chalk better by St. Christopher; or at least as good.  You’ll see that even by the ‘Sea Cook.’</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Jerry Abershaw—O what a title!  Jerry Abershaw: d-n it, sir, it’s a poem.  The two most lovely words in English; and what a sentiment!  Hark you, how the hoofs ring!  Is this a blacksmith’s?  No, it’s a wayside inn.  Jerry Abershaw.  ‘It was a clear, frosty evening, not 100 miles from Putney,’ etc.  Jerry Abershaw.  Jerry Abershaw.  Jerry Abershaw.  The ‘Sea Cook’ is now in its sixteenth chapter, and bids for well up in the thirties.  Each three chapters is worth £2, 10s.  So we’ve £12, 10s. already.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Don’t read Marryat’s’ <hi rend="italic">Pirate</hi> anyhow; it is written in sand with a salt-spoon: arid, feeble, vain, tottering production.  But then we’re not always all there.  <hi rend="italic">He</hi> was <hi rend="italic">all</hi> somewhere else that trip.  It’s <hi rend="italic">damnable</hi>, Henley.  I don’t go much on the ‘Sea Cook’; but, Lord, it’s a little fruitier than the <hi rend="italic">Pirate</hi> by Cap’n. Marryat.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Since this was written ‘The Cook’ is in his nineteenth chapter.  Yo-heave ho!</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR MR. HAMERTON,—My conscience has long been smiting me, till it became nearly chronic.  My excuses, however, are many and not pleasant.  Almost immediately after I last wrote to you, I had a hemorreage (I can’t spell it), was badly treated by a doctor in the country, and have been a long while picking up—still, in fact, have much to desire on that side.  Next, as soon as I got here, my wife took ill; she is, I fear, seriously so; and this combination of two invalids very much depresses both.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I have a volume of republished essays coming out with Chatto and Windus; I wish they would come, that my wife might have the reviews to divert her.  Otherwise my news is <hi rend="italic">nil</hi>.  I am up here in a little chalet, on the borders of a pinewood, overlooking a great part of the Davos Thal, a beautiful scene at night, with the moon upon the snowy mountains, and the lights warmly shining in the village.  J. A. Symonds is next door to me, just at the foot of my Hill Difficulty (this you will please regard as the House Beautiful), and his society is my great stand-by.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Did you see I had joined the band of the rejected?  ‘Hardly one of us,’ said my <hi rend="italic">confrères</hi> at the bar.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I was blamed by a common friend for asking you to give me a testimonial; in the circumstances he thought it was indelicate.  Lest, by some calamity, you should ever have felt the same way, I must say in two words how the matter appeared to me.  That silly story of the election altered in no tittle the value of your testimony: so much for that.  On the other hand, it led me to take quite a particular pleasure in asking you to give it; and so much for the other.  I trust, even if you cannot share it, you will understand my view.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I am in treaty with Bentley for a life of Hazlitt; I hope it will not fall through, as I love the subject, and appear to have found a publisher who loves it also.  That, I think, makes things more pleasant.  You know I am a fervent Hazlittite; I mean regarding him as <hi rend="italic">the</hi> English writer who has had the scantiest justice.  Besides which, I am anxious to write biography; really, if I understand myself in quest of profit, I think it must be good to live with another man from birth to death.  You have tried it, and know.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">How has the cruising gone?  Pray remember me to Mrs. Hamerton and your son, and believe me, yours very sincerely,</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR CHARLES,—We have been in miserable case here; my wife worse and worse; and now sent away with Lloyd for sick nurse, I not being allowed to go down.  I do not know what is to become of us; and you may imagine how rotten I have been feeling, and feel now, alone with my weasel-dog and my German maid, on the top of a hill here, heavy mist and thin snow all about me, and the devil to pay in general.  I don’t care so much for solitude as I used to; results, I suppose, of marriage.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Pray write me something cheery.  A little Edinburgh gossip, in Heaven’s name.  Ah! what would I not give to steal this evening with you through the big, echoing, college archway, and away south under the street lamps, and away to dear Brash’s, now defunct!  But the old time is dead also, never, never to revive.  It was a sad time too, but so gay and so hopeful, and we had such sport with all our low spirits and all our distresses, that it looks like a kind of lamplit fairyland behind me.  O for ten Edinburgh minutes—sixpence between us, and the ever-glorious Lothian Road, or dear mysterious Leith Walk!  But here, a sheer hulk, lies poor Tom Bowling; here in this strange place, whose very strangeness would have been heaven to him then; and aspires, yes, C. B., with tears, after the past.  See what comes of being left alone.  Do you remember Brash? the sheet of glass that we followed along George Street?  Granton? the blight at Bonny mainhead? the compass near the sign of the <hi rend="italic">Twinkling Eye</hi>? the night I lay on the pavement in misery?</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR MOTHER,—Yesterday, Sunday and Christmas, we finished this eventful journey by a drive in an <hi rend="italic">open</hi> sleigh—none others were to be had—seven hours on end through whole forests of Christmas trees.  The cold was beyond belief.  I have often suffered less at a dentist’s.  It was a clear, sunny day, but the sun even at noon falls, at this season, only here and there into the Prättigau.  I kept up as long as I could in an imitation of a street singer:—</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Away, ye gay landscapes, ye gardens of roses, etc.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">At last Lloyd remarked, a blue mouth speaking from a corpse-coloured face, ‘You seem to be the only one with any courage left?’  And, do you know, with that word my courage disappeared, and I made the rest of the stage in the same dumb wretchedness as the others.  My only terror was lest Fanny should ask for brandy, or laudanum, or something.  So awful was the idea of putting my hands out, that I half thought I would refuse.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Well, none of us are a penny the worse, Lloyd’s cold better; I, with a twinge of the rheumatic; and Fanny better than her ordinary.</p>

                     <p rend="justify">Our dog is very ill again, poor fellow, looks very ill too, only sleeps at night because of morphine; and we do not know what ails him, only fear it to be canker of the ear.  He makes a bad, black spot in our life, poor, selfish, silly, little tangle; and my wife is wretched.  Otherwise she is better, steadily and slowly moving up through all her relapses.  My knee never gets the least better; it hurts to-night, which it has not done for long.  I do not suppose my doctor knows any least thing about it.  He says it is a nerve that I struck, but I assure you he does not know.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I have just finished a paper, ‘A Gossip on Romance,’ in which I have tried to do, very popularly, about one-half of the matter you wanted me to try.  In a way, I have found an answer to the question.  But the subject was hardly fit for so chatty a paper, and it is all loose ends.  If ever I do my book on the Art of Literature, I shall gather them together and be clear.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">To-morrow, having once finished off the touches still due on this, I shall tackle <hi rend="italic">San Francisco</hi> for you.  Then the tide of work will fairly bury me, lost to view and hope.  You have no idea what it costs me to wring out my work now.  I have certainly been a fortnight over this Romance, sometimes five hours a day; and yet it is about my usual length—eight pages or so, and would be a d-d sight the better for another curry.  But I do not think I can honestly re-write it all; so I call it done, and shall only straighten words in a revision currently.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I had meant to go on for a great while, and say all manner of entertaining things.  But all’s gone.  I am now an idiot.—Yours ever,</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR HENLEY,—. . . Last night we had a dinner-party, consisting of the John Addington, curry, onions (lovely onions), and beefsteak.  So unusual is any excitement, that F. and I feel this morning as if we had been to a coronation.  However I must, I suppose, write.</p>

                     <p rend="justify">O that Coronation!  What a shouting crowd there was!  I obviously got a firework in each eye.  The king looked very magnificent, to be sure; and that great hall where we feasted on seven hundred delicate foods, and drank fifty royal wines—<hi rend="italic">quel coup d’œil</hi>! but was it not over-done, even for a coronation—almost a vulgar luxury?  And eleven is certainly too late to begin dinner.  (It was really 6.30 instead of 5.30.)</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Your list of books that Cassells have refused in these weeks is not quite complete; they also refused:—</p>
                     <p rend="justify">1. Six undiscovered Tragedies, one romantic Comedy, a fragment of Journal extending over six years, and an unfinished Autobiography reaching up to the first performance of King John.  By William Shakespeare.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">2. The journals and Private Correspondence of David, King of Israel.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">3. Poetical Works of Arthur, Iron Dook of Wellington, including a Monody on Napoleon.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">4. Eight books of an unfinished novel, <hi rend="italic">Solomon Crabb</hi>.  By Henry Fielding.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">5. Stevenson’s Moral Emblems.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">You also neglected to mention, as <hi rend="italic">per contra</hi>, that they had during the same time accepted and triumphantly published Brown’s <hi rend="italic">Handbook to Cricket</hi>, Jones’s <hi rend="italic">First</hi> 
                        <hi rend="italic">French Reader</hi>, and Robinson’s <hi rend="italic">Picturesque Cheshire</hi>, uniform with the same author’s <hi rend="italic">Stately Homes of Salop</hi>.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">O if that list could come true!  How we would tear at Solomon Crabb!  O what a bully, bully, bully business.  Which would you read first—Shakespeare’s autobiography, or his journals?  What sport the monody on Napoleon would be—what wooden verse, what stucco ornament!  I should read both the autobiography and the journals before I looked at one of the plays, beyond the names of them, which shows that Saintsbury was right, and I do care more for life than for poetry.  No—I take it back.  Do you know one of the tragedies—a Bible tragedy too—<hi rend="italic">David</hi>—was written in his third period—much about the same time as Lear?  The comedy, <hi rend="italic">April Rain</hi>, is also a late work.  <hi rend="italic">Beckett</hi> is a fine ranting piece, like <hi rend="italic">Richard II.</hi>, but very fine for the stage.  Irving is to play it this autumn when I’m in town; the part rather suits him—but who is to play Henry—a tremendous creation, sir.  Betterton in his private journal seems to have seen this piece; and he says distinctly that Henry is the best part in any play.  ‘Though,’ he adds, ‘how it be with the ancient plays I know not.  But in this I have ever feared to do ill, and indeed will not be persuaded to that undertaking.’  So says Betterton.  <hi rend="italic">Rufus</hi> is not so good; I am not pleased with <hi rend="italic">Rufus</hi>; plainly a <hi rend="italic">rifaccimento</hi> of some inferior work; but there are some damned fine lines.  As for the purely satiric ill-minded <hi rend="italic">Abelard and Heloise</hi>, another <hi rend="italic">Troilus</hi>, <hi rend="italic">quoi</hi>! it is not pleasant, truly, but what strength, what verve, what knowledge of life, and the Canon!  What a finished, humorous, rich picture is the Canon!  Ah, there was nobody like Shakespeare.  But what I like is the David and Absalom business.  Absalom is so well felt—you love him as David did; David’s speech is one roll of royal music from the first act to the fifth.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I am enjoying <hi rend="italic">Solomon Crabb</hi> extremely; Solomon’s capital adventure with the two highwaymen and Squire Trecothick and Parson Vance; it is as good, I think, as anything in Joseph Andrews.  I have just come to the part where the highwayman with the black patch over his eye has tricked poor Solomon into his place, and the squire and the parson are hearing the evidence.  Parson Vance is splendid.  How good, too, is old Mrs. Crabb and the coastguardsman in the third chapter, or her delightful quarrel with the sexton of Seaham; Lord Conybeare is surely a little overdone; but I don’t know either; he’s such damned fine sport.  Do you like Sally Barnes?  I’m in love with her.  Constable Muddon is as good as Dogberry and Verges put together; when he takes Solomon to the cage, and the highwayman gives him Solomon’s own guinea for his pains, and kisses Mrs. Muddon, and just then up drives Lord Conybeare, and instead of helping Solomon, calls him all the rascals in Christendom—O Henry Fielding, Henry Fielding!  Yet perhaps the scenes at Seaham are the best.  But I’m bewildered among all these excellences.</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR SIR,—This formidable paper need not alarm you; it argues nothing beyond penury of other sorts, and is not at all likely to lead me into a long letter.  If I were at all grateful it would, for yours has just passed for me a considerable part of a stormy evening.  And speaking of gratitude, let me at once and with becoming eagerness accept your kind invitation to Bowdon.  I shall hope, if we can agree as to dates when I am nearer hand, to come to you sometime in the month of May.  I was pleased to hear you were a Scot; I feel more at home with my compatriots always; perhaps the more we are away, the stronger we feel that bond.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">You ask about Davos; I have discoursed about it already, rather sillily I think, in the <hi rend="italic">Pall Mall</hi>, and I mean to say no more, but the ways of the Muse are dubious and obscure, and who knows?  I may be wiled again.  As a place of residence, beyond a splendid climate, it has to my eyes but one advantage—the neighbourhood of J. A. Symonds—I dare say you know his work, but the man is far more interesting.  It has done me, in my two winters’ Alpine exile, much good; so much, that I hope to leave it now for ever, but would not be understood to boast.  In my present unpardonably crazy state, any cold might send me skipping, either back to Davos, or further off.  Let us hope not.  It is dear; a little dreary; very far from many things that both my taste and my needs prompt me to seek; and altogether not the place that I should choose of my free will.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I am chilled by your description of the man in question, though I had almost argued so much from his cold and undigested volume.  If the republication does not interfere with my publisher, it will not interfere with me; but there, of course, comes the hitch.  I do not know Mr. Bentley, and I fear all publishers like the devil from legend and experience both.  However, when I come to town, we shall, I hope, meet and understand each other as well as author and publisher ever do.  I liked his letters; they seemed hearty, kind, and personal.  Still—I am notedly suspicious of the trade—your news of this republication alarms me.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">The best of the present French novelists seems to me, incomparably, Daudet.  <hi rend="italic">Les Rois en Exil</hi> comes very near being a masterpiece.  For Zola I have no toleration, though the curious, eminently bourgeois, and eminently French creature has power of a kind.  But I would he were deleted.  I would not give a chapter of old Dumas (meaning himself, not his collaborators) for the whole boiling of the Zolas.  Romance with the smallpox—as the great one: diseased anyway and blackhearted and fundamentally at enmity with joy.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I trust that Mrs. Ireland does not object to smoking; and if you are a teetotaller, I beg you to mention it before I come—I have all the vices; some of the virtues also, let us hope—that, at least, of being a Scotchman, and yours very sincerely,</p>

                     <p rend="justify">I would send you the book; but I declare I’m ruined.  I got a penny a cut and a halfpenny a set of verses from the flint-hearted publisher, and only one specimen copy, as I’m a sinner.  — was apostolic alongside of Osbourne.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I hope you will be able to decipher this, written at steam speed with a breaking pen, the hotfast postman at my heels.  No excuse, says you.  None, sir, says I, and touches my ’at most civil (extraordinary evolution of pen, now quite doomed—to resume—)  I have not put pen to the Bloody Murder yet.  But it is early on my list; and when once I get to it, three weeks should see the last bloodstain—maybe a fortnight.  For I am beginning to combine an extraordinary laborious slowness while at work, with the most surprisingly quick results in the way of finished manuscripts.  How goes Gray?  Colvin is to do Keats.  My wife is still not well.—Yours ever,</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR DR. JAPP,—A good day to date this letter, which is in fact a confession of incapacity.  During my wife’s illness I somewhat lost my head, and entirely lost a great quire of corrected proofs.  This is one of the results; I hope there are none more serious.  I was never so sick of any volume as I was of that; was continually receiving fresh proofs with fresh infinitesimal difficulties.  I was ill—I did really fear my wife was worse than ill.  Well, it’s out now; and though I have observed several carelessnesses myself, and now here’s another of your finding—of which, indeed, I ought to be ashamed—it will only justify the sweeping humility of the Preface.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Symonds was actually dining with us when your letter came, and I communicated your remarks. . . . He is a far better and more interesting thing than any of his books.</p>

                     <p rend="justify">My wicked carcase, as John Knox calls it, holds together wonderfully.  In addition to many other things, and a volume of travel, I find I have written, since December, 90 <hi rend="italic">Cornhill</hi> pages of magazine work—essays and stories: 40,000 words, and I am none the worse—I am the better.  I begin to hope I may, if not outlive this wolverine upon my shoulders, at least carry him bravely like Symonds and Alexander Pope.  I begin to take a pride in that hope.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I shall be much interested to see your criticisms; you might perhaps send them to me.  I believe you know that is not dangerous; one folly I have not—I am not touchy under criticism.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Lloyd and my wife both beg to be remembered; and Lloyd sends as a present a work of his own.  I hope you feel flattered; for this is <hi rend="italic">simply the first time he has ever given one away</hi>.  I have to buy my own works, I can tell you.—Yours very sincerely,</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR HENLEY,—I hope and hope for a long letter—soon I hope to be superseded by long talks—and it comes not.  I remember I have never formally thanked you for that hundred quid, nor in general for the introduction to Chatto and Windus, and continue to bury you in copy as if you were my private secretary.  Well, I am not unconscious of it all; but I think least said is often best, generally best; gratitude is a tedious sentiment, it’s not ductile, not dramatic.</p>

                     <p rend="justify">There remain: C. B., the Williamses—you know they were the parties who stuck up for us about our marriage, and Mrs. W. was my guardian angel, and our Best Man and Bridesmaid rolled in one, and the only third of the wedding party—my sister-in-law, who is booked for <hi rend="italic">Prince Otto</hi>—Jenkin I suppose sometime—George Meredith, the only man of genius of my acquaintance, and then I believe I’ll have to take to the dead, the immortal memory business.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Talking of Meredith, I have just re-read for the third and fourth time <hi rend="italic">The Egoist</hi>.  When I shall have read it the sixth or seventh, I begin to see I shall know about it.  You will be astonished when you come to re-read it; I had no idea of the matter—human, red matter he has contrived to plug and pack into that strange and admirable book.  Willoughby is, of course, a pure discovery; a complete set of nerves, not heretofore examined, and yet running all over the human body—a suit of nerves.  Clara is the best girl ever I saw anywhere.  Vernon is almost as good.  The manner and the faults of the book greatly justify themselves on further study.  Only Dr. Middleton does not hang together; and Ladies Busshe and Culmer <hi rend="italic">sont des monstruosités</hi>.  Vernon’s conduct makes a wonderful odd contrast with Daniel Deronda’s.  I see more and more that Meredith is built for immortality.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Talking of which, Heywood, as a small immortal, an immortalet, claims some attention.  <hi rend="italic">The Woman killed with Kindness</hi> is one of the most striking novels—not plays, though it’s more of a play than anything else of his—I ever read.  He had such a sweet, sound soul, the old boy.  The death of the two pirates in <hi rend="italic">Fortune by Sea and</hi> 
                        <hi rend="italic">Land</hi> is a document.  He had obviously been present, and heard Purser and Clinton take death by the beard with similar braggadocios.  Purser and Clinton, names of pirates; Scarlet and Bobbington, names of highwaymen.  He had the touch of names, I think.  No man I ever knew had such a sense, such a tact, for English nomenclature: Rainsforth, Lacy, Audley, Forrest, Acton, Spencer, Frankford—so his names run.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Byron not only wrote <hi rend="italic">Don Juan</hi>; he called Joan of Arc ‘a fanatical strumpet.’  These are his words.  I think the double shame, first to a great poet, second to an English noble, passes words.</p>

                     <p rend="justify">I am still far from satisfied about Fanny; she is certainly better, but it is by fits a good deal, and the symptoms continue, which should not be.  I had her persuaded to leave without me this very day (Saturday 8th), but the disclosure of my mismanagement broke up that plan; she would not leave me lest I should mismanage more.  I think this an unfair revenge; but I have been so bothered that I cannot struggle.  All Davos has been drinking our wine.  During the month of March, three litres a day were drunk—O it is too sickening—and that is only a specimen.  It is enough to make any one a misanthrope, but the right thing is to hate the donkey that was duped—which I devoutly do.</p>

                     <p rend="justify">I thought this would interest you, so scribbled it down.  I still hope to get more out of him about Hazlitt, though he utterly pooh-poohed the idea of writing H.’s life.  ‘Ma life now,’ he said, ‘there’s been queer things in <hi rend="italic">it</hi>.’  He is seventy-nine! but may well last to a hundred!—Yours ever,</p>

                     <p rend="justify">SIR,—It has come to my ears that you have lent the authority of your columns to an error.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">More than half in pleasantry—and I now think the pleasantry ill-judged—I complained in a note to my <hi rend="italic">New Arabian Nights</hi> that some one, who shall remain nameless for me, had borrowed the idea of a story from one of mine.  As if I had not borrowed the ideas of the half of my own!  As if any one who had written a story ill had a right to complain of any other who should have written it better!  I am indeed thoroughly ashamed of the note, and of the principle which it implies.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">But it is no mere abstract penitence which leads me to beg a corner of your paper—it is the desire to defend the honour of a man of letters equally known in America and England, of a man who could afford to lend to me and yet be none the poorer; and who, if he would so far condescend, has my free permission to borrow from me all that he can find worth borrowing.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Indeed, sir, I am doubly surprised at your correspondent’s error.  That James Payn should have borrowed from me is already a strange conception.  The author of <hi rend="italic">Lost Sir Massingberd</hi> and <hi rend="italic">By Proxy</hi> may be trusted to invent his own stories.  The author of <hi rend="italic">A Grape from a Thorn</hi> knows enough, in his own right, of the humorous and pathetic sides of human nature.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">But what is far more monstrous—what argues total ignorance of the man in question—is the idea that James Payn could ever have transgressed the limits of professional propriety.  I may tell his thousands of readers on your side of the Atlantic that there breathes no man of letters more inspired by kindness and generosity to his brethren of the profession, and, to put an end to any possibility of error, I may be allowed to add that I often have recourse, and that I had recourse once more but a few weeks ago, to the valuable practical help which he makes it his pleasure to extend to younger men.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I send a duplicate of this letter to a London weekly; for the mistake, first set forth in your columns, has already reached England, and my wanderings have made me perhaps last of the persons interested to hear a word of it.—I am, etc.,</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR CUMMY,—You must think, and quite justly, that I am one of the meanest rogues in creation.  But though I do not write (which is a thing I hate), it by no means follows that people are out of my mind.  It is natural that I should always think more or less about you, and still more natural that I should think of you when I went back to Nice.  But the real reason why you have been more in my mind than usual is because of some little verses that I have been writing, and that I mean to make a book of; and the real reason of this letter (although I ought to have written to you anyway) is that I have just seen that the book in question must be dedicated to</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Alison Cunningham,</p>
                     <p rend="justify">the only person who will really understand it.  I don’t know when it may be ready, for it has to be illustrated, but I hope in the meantime you may like the idea of what is to be; and when the time comes, I shall try to make the dedication as pretty as I can make it.  Of course, this is only a flourish, like taking off one’s hat; but still, a person who has taken the trouble to write things does not dedicate them to any one without meaning it; and you must just try to take this dedication in place of a great many things that I might have said, and that I ought to have done, to prove that I am not altogether unconscious of the great debt of gratitude I owe you.  This little book, which is all about my childhood, should indeed go to no other person but you, who did so much to make that childhood happy.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Do you know, we came very near sending for you this winter.  If we had not had news that you were ill too, I almost believe we should have done so, we were so much in trouble.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I am now very well; but my wife has had a very, very bad spell, through overwork and anxiety, when I was <hi rend="italic">lost</hi>!  I suppose you heard of that.  She sends you her love, and hopes you will write to her, though she no more than I deserves it.  She would add a word herself, but she is too played out.—I am, ever your old boy,</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR LAD,—This is to announce to you the MS. of Nursery Verses, now numbering XLVIII. pieces or 599 verses, which, of course, one might augment <hi rend="italic">ad infinitum</hi>.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">But here is my notion to make all clear.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I do not want a big ugly quarto; my soul sickens at the look of a quarto.  I want a refined octavo, not large—not <hi rend="italic">larger</hi> than the <hi rend="italic">Donkey Book</hi>, at any price.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I think the full page might hold four verses of four lines, that is to say, counting their blanks at two, of twenty-two lines in height.  The first page of each number would only hold two verses or ten lines, the title being low down.  At this rate, we should have seventy-eight or eighty pages of letterpress.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">The designs should not be in the text, but facing the poem; so that if the artist liked, he might give two pages of design to every poem that turned the leaf, <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> longer than eight lines, <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> to twenty-eight out of the forty-six.  I should say he would not use this privilege (?) above five times, and some he might scorn to illustrate at all, so we may say fifty drawings.  I shall come to the drawings next.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">But now you see my book of the thickness, since the drawings count two pages, of 180 pages; and since the paper will perhaps be thicker, of near two hundred by bulk.  It is bound in a quiet green with the words in thin gilt.  Its shape is a slender, tall octavo.  And it sells for the publisher’s fancy, and it will be a darling to look at; in short, it would be like one of the original Heine books in type and spacing.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Now for the pictures.  I take another sheet and begin to jot notes for them when my imagination serves: I will run through the book, writing when I have an idea.  There, I have jotted enough to give the artist a notion.  Of course, I don’t do more than contribute ideas, but I will be happy to help in any and every way.  I may as well add another idea; when the artist finds nothing much to illustrate, a good drawing of any <hi rend="italic">object</hi> mentioned in the text, were it only a loaf of bread or a candlestick, is a most delightful thing to a young child.  I remember this keenly.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Of course, if the artist insists on a larger form, I must I suppose, bow my head.  But my idea I am convinced is the best, and would make the book truly, not fashionably pretty.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I forgot to mention that I shall have a dedication; I am going to dedicate ’em to Cummy; it will please her, and lighten a little my burthen of ingratitude.  A low affair is the Muse business.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I will add no more to this lest you should want to communicate with the artist; try another sheet.  I wonder how many I’ll keep wandering to.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">O I forgot.  As for the title, I think ‘Nursery Verses’ the best.  Poetry is not the strong point of the text, and I shrink from any title that might seem to claim that quality; otherwise we might have ‘Nursery Muses’ or ‘New Songs of Innocence’ (but that were a blasphemy), or ‘Rimes of Innocence’: the last not bad, or—an idea—‘The Jews’ Harp,’ or—now I have it—‘The Penny Whistle.’</p>

                     <p rend="justify">DEAR SIR,—Your undated favour from Eastbourne came to hand in course of post, and I now hasten to acknowledge its receipt.  We must ask you in future, for the convenience of our business arrangements, to struggle with and tread below your feet this most unsatisfactory and uncommercial habit.  Our Mr. Cassandra is better; our Mr. Wogg expresses himself dissatisfied with our new place of business; when left alone in the front shop, he bawled like a parrot; it is supposed the offices are haunted.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">To turn to the matter of your letter, your remarks on <hi rend="italic">Great Expectations</hi> are very good.  We have both re-read it this winter, and I, in a manner, twice.  The object being a play; the play, in its rough outline, I now see: and it is extraordinary how much of Dickens had to be discarded as unhuman, impossible, and ineffective: all that really remains is the loan of a file (but from a grown-up young man who knows what he was doing, and to a convict who, although he does not know it is his father—the father knows it is his son), and the fact of the convict-father’s return and disclosure of himself to the son whom he has made rich.  Everything else has been thrown aside; and the position has had to be explained by a prologue which is pretty strong.  I have great hopes of this piece, which is very amiable and, in places, very strong indeed: but it was curious how Dickens had to be rolled away; he had made his story turn on such improbabilities, such fantastic trifles, not on a good human basis, such as I recognised.  You are right about the casts, they were a capital idea; a good description of them at first, and then afterwards, say second, for the lawyer to have illustrated points out of the history of the originals, dusting the particular bust—that was all the development the thing would bear.  Dickens killed them.  The only really well <hi rend="italic">executed</hi> scenes are the riverside ones; the escape in particular is excellent; and I may add, the capture of the two convicts at the beginning.  Miss Havisham is, probably, the worst thing in human fiction.  But Wemmick I like; and I like Trabb’s boy; and Mr. Wopsle as Hamlet is splendid.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">The weather here is greatly improved, and I hope in three days to be in the chalet.  That is, if I get some money to float me there.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I hope you are all right again, and will keep better.  The month of March is past its mid career; it must soon begin to turn toward the lamb; here it has already begun to do so; and I hope milder weather will pick you up.  Wogg has eaten a forpet of rice and milk, his beard is streaming, his eyes wild.  I am besieged by demands of work from America.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">The £50 has just arrived; many thanks; I am now at ease.—Ever your affectionate son, <hi rend="italic">pro</hi> Cassandra, Wogg and Co.,</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR FRIEND,—I am one of the lowest of the—but that’s understood.  I received the copy, <ref target="#1730040348670317495_622-h-3.htm.xhtml#footnote263">[263]</ref> excellently written, with I think only one slip from first to last.  I have struck out two, and added five or six; so they now number forty-five; when they are fifty, they shall out on the world.  I have not written a letter for a cruel time; I have been, and am, so busy, drafting a long story (for me, I mean), about a hundred <hi rend="italic">Cornhill</hi> pages, or say about as long as the Donkey book: <hi rend="italic">Prince Otto</hi> it is called, and is, at the present hour, a sore burthen but a hopeful.  If I had him all drafted, I should whistle and sing.  But no: then I’ll have to rewrite him; and then there will be the publishers, alas!  But some time or other, I shall whistle and sing, I make no doubt.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I am going to make a fortune, it has not yet begun, for I am not yet clear of debt; but as soon as I can, I begin upon the fortune.  I shall begin it with a halfpenny, and it shall end with horses and yachts and all the fun of the fair.  This is the first real grey hair in my character: rapacity has begun to show, the greed of the protuberant guttler.  Well, doubtless, when the hour strikes, we must all guttle and protube.  But it comes hard on one who was always so willow-slender and as careless as the daisies.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Truly I am in excellent spirits.  I have crushed through a financial crisis; Fanny is much better; I am in excellent health, and work from four to five hours a day—from one to two above my average, that is; and we all dwell together and make fortunes in the loveliest house you ever saw, with a garden like a fairy story, and a view like a classical landscape.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Little?  Well, it is not large.  And when you come to see us, you will probably have to bed at the hotel, which is hard by.  But it is Eden, madam, Eden and Beulah and the Delectable Mountains and Eldorado and the Hesperidean Isles and Bimini.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">We both look forward, my dear friend, with the greatest eagerness to have you here.  It seems it is not to be this season; but I appoint you with an appointment for next season.  You cannot see us else: remember that.  Till my health has grown solid like an oak-tree, till my fortune begins really to spread its boughs like the same monarch of the woods (and the acorn, ay de mi! is not yet planted), I expect to be a prisoner among the palms.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Yes, it is like old times to be writing you from the Riviera, and after all that has come and gone who can predict anything?  How fortune tumbles men about!  Yet I have not found that they change their friends, thank God.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Both of our loves to your sister and yourself.  As for me, if I am here and happy, I know to whom I owe it; I know who made my way for me in life, if that were all, and I remain, with love, your faithful friend,</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR GOSSE,—I am very guilty; I should have written to you long ago; and now, though it must be done, I am so stupid that I can only boldly recapitulate.  A phrase of three members is the outside of my syntax.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">First, I liked the <hi rend="italic">Rover</hi> better than any of your other verse.  I believe you are right, and can make stories in verse.  The last two stanzas and one or two in the beginning—but the two last above all—I thought excellent.  I suggest a pursuit of the vein.  If you want a good story to treat, get the <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of the </hi>
                        <hi rend="italic">Chevalier Johnstone</hi>, and do his passage of the Tay; it would be excellent: the dinner in the field, the woman he has to follow, the dragoons, the timid boatmen, the brave lasses.  It would go like a charm; look at it, and you will say you owe me one.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Second, Gilder asking me for fiction, I suddenly took a great resolve, and have packed off to him my new work, <hi rend="italic">The Silverado Squatters</hi>.  I do not for a moment suppose he will take it; but pray say all the good words you can for it.  I should be awfully glad to get it taken.  But if it does not mean dibbs at once, I shall be ruined for life.  Pray write soon and beg Gilder your prettiest for a poor gentleman in pecuniary sloughs.</p>

                     <p rend="justify">The weather, to look at the per contra sheet, continues vomitable; and Fanny is quite out of sorts.  But, really, with such cause of gladness, I have not the heart to be dispirited by anything.  My child’s verse book is finished, dedication and all, and out of my hands—you may tell Cummy; <hi rend="italic">Silverado</hi> is done, too, and cast upon the waters; and this novel so near completion, it does look as if I should support myself without trouble in the future.  If I have only health, I can, I thank God.  It is dreadful to be a great, big man, and not be able to buy bread.</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR PEOPLE,—I was disgusted to hear my father was not so well.  I have a most troubled existence of work and business.  But the work goes well, which is the great affair.  I meant to have written a most delightful letter; too tired, however, and must stop.  Perhaps I’ll find time to add to it ere post.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I have returned refreshed from eating, but have little time, as Lloyd will go soon with the letters on his way to his tutor, Louis Robert (!!!!), with whom he learns Latin in French, and French, I suppose, in Latin, which seems to me a capital education.  He, Lloyd, is a great bicycler already, and has been long distances; he is most new-fangled over his instrument, and does not willingly converse on other subjects.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Our lovely garden is a prey to snails; I have gathered about a bushel, which, not having the heart to slay, I steal forth withal and deposit near my neighbour’s garden wall.  As a case of casuistry, this presents many points of interest.  I loathe the snails, but from loathing to actual butchery, trucidation of multitudes, there is still a step that I hesitate to take.  What, then, to do with them?  My neighbour’s vineyard, pardy!  It is a rich, villa, pleasure-garden of course; if it were a peasant’s patch, the snails, I suppose, would have to perish.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">The weather these last three days has been much better, though it is still windy and unkind.  I keep splendidly well, and am cruelly busy, with mighty little time even for a walk.  And to write at all, under such pressure, must be held to lean to virtue’s side.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">My financial prospects are shining.  O if the health will hold, I should easily support myself.—Your ever affectionate son,</p>

                     <p rend="justify">I send the MS. by Henley, because he acts for me in all matters, and had the thing, like all my other books, in his detention.  He is my unpaid agent—an admirable arrangement for me, and one that has rather more than doubled my income on the spot.</p>

The influenza has busted me a good deal; I have no spring, and am headachy.  So, as my good Red Lion Counter begged me for another Butcher’s Boy—I turned me to—what thinkest ’ou?—to Tushery, by the mass!  Ay, friend, a whole tale of tushery.  And every tusher tushes me so free, that may I be tushed if the whole thing is worth a tush.  <hi rend="italic">The Black Arrow</hi>: <hi rend="italic">A Tale of Tunstall Forest</hi> is his name: tush! a poor thing!</p>

                     <p rend="justify">DEAR LAD,—I was delighted to hear the good news about —.  Bravo, he goes uphill fast.  Let him beware of vanity, and he will go higher; let him be still discontented, and let him (if it might be) see the merits and not the faults of his rivals, and he may swarm at last to the top-gallant.  There is no other way.  Admiration is the only road to excellence; and the critical spirit kills, but envy and injustice are putrefaction on its feet.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Thus far the moralist.  The eager author now begs to know whether you may have got the other Whistles, and whether a fresh proof is to be taken; also whether in that case the dedication should not be printed therewith; <hi rend="italic">B</hi>ulk <hi rend="italic">D</hi>elights <hi rend="italic">P</hi>ublishers (original aphorism; to be said sixteen times in succession as a test of sobriety).</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Your wild and ravening commands were received; but cannot be obeyed.  And anyway, I do assure you I am getting better every day; and if the weather would but turn, I should soon be observed to walk in hornpipes.  Truly I am on the mend.  I am still very careful.  I have the new dictionary; a joy, a thing of beauty, and—bulk.  I shall be raked i’ the mools before it’s finished; that is the only pity; but meanwhile I sing.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I beg to inform you that I, Robert Louis Stevenson, author of <hi rend="italic">Brashiana</hi> and other works, am merely beginning to commence to prepare to make a first start at trying to understand my profession.  O the height and depth of novelty and worth in any art! and O that I am privileged to swim and shoulder through such oceans!  Could one get out of sight of land—all in the blue?  Alas not, being anchored here in flesh, and the bonds of logic being still about us.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">But what a great space and a great air there is in these small shallows where alone we venture! and how new each sight, squall, calm, or sunrise!  An art is a fine fortune, a palace in a park, a band of music, health, and physical beauty; all but love—to any worthy practiser.  I sleep upon my art for a pillow; I waken in my art; I am unready for death, because I hate to leave it.  I love my wife, I do not know how much, nor can, nor shall, unless I lost her; but while I can conceive my being widowed, I refuse the offering of life without my art.  I <hi rend="italic">am</hi> not but in my art; it is me; I am the body of it merely.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">And yet I produce nothing, am the author of <hi rend="italic">Brashiana</hi> and other works: tiddy-iddity—as if the works one wrote were anything but ‘prentice’s experiments.  Dear reader, I deceive you with husks, the real works and all the pleasure are still mine and incommunicable.  After this break in my work, beginning to return to it, as from light sleep, I wax exclamatory, as you see.</p>

                     <p rend="justify">Your remarks about the ugly are my eye.  Ugliness is only the prose of horror.  It is when you are not able to write <hi rend="italic">Macbeth</hi> that you write <hi rend="italic">Thérèse Raquin</hi>.  Fashions are external: the essence of art only varies in so far as fashion widens the field of its application; art is a mill whose thirlage, in different ages, widens and contracts; but, in any case and under any fashion, the great man produces beauty, terror, and mirth, and the little man produces cleverness (personalities, psychology) instead of beauty, ugliness instead of terror, and jokes instead of mirth.  As it was in the beginning, is now, and shall be ever, world without end.  Amen!</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR CUMMY,—Yes, I own I am a real bad correspondent, and am as bad as can be in most directions.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I have been adding some more poems to your book.  I wish they would look sharp about it; but, you see, they are trying to find a good artist to make the illustrations, without which no child would give a kick for it.  It will be quite a fine work, I hope.  The dedication is a poem too, and has been quite a long while written, but I do not mean you to see it till you get the book; keep the jelly for the last, you know, as you would often recommend in former days, so now you can take your own medicine.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I am very sorry to hear you have been so poorly; I have been very well; it used to be quite the other way, used it not?  Do you remember making the whistle at Mount Chessie?  I do not think it <hi rend="italic">was</hi> my knife; I believe it was yours; but rhyme is a very great monarch, and goes before honesty, in these affairs at least.  Do you remember, at Warriston, one autumn Sunday, when the beech nuts were on the ground, seeing heaven open?  I would like to make a rhyme of that, but cannot.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Is it not strange to think of all the changes: Bob, Cramond, Delhi, Minnie, and Henrietta, all married, and fathers and mothers, and your humble servant just the one point better off?  And such a little while ago all children together!  The time goes swift and wonderfully even; and if we are no worse than we are, we should be grateful to the power that guides us.  For more than a generation I have now been to the fore in this rough world, and been most tenderly helped, and done cruelly wrong, and yet escaped; and here I am still, the worse for wear, but with some fight in me still, and not unthankful—no, surely not unthankful, or I were then the worst of human beings!</p>
                     <p rend="justify">My little dog is a very much better child in every way, both more loving and more amiable; but he is not fond of strangers, and is, like most of his kind, a great, specious humbug.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Fanny has been ill, but is much better again; she now goes donkey rides with an old woman, who compliments her on her French.  That old woman—seventy odd—is in a parlous spiritual state.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Pretty soon, in the new sixpenny illustrated magazine, Wogg’s picture is to appear: this is a great honour!  And the poor soul whose vanity would just explode if he could understand it, will never be a bit the wiser!—With much love, in which Fanny joins, believe me, your affectionate boy,</p>

                     <p rend="justify">DEAR LAD,—Snatches in return for yours; for this little once, I’m well to windward of you.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Seventeen chapters of <hi rend="italic">Otto</hi> are now drafted, and finding I was working through my voice and getting screechy, I have turned back again to rewrite the earlier part.  It has, I do believe, some merit: of what order, of course, I am the last to know; and, triumph of triumphs, my wife—my wife who hates and loathes and slates my women—admits a great part of my Countess to be on the spot.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Yes, I could borrow, but it is the joy of being before the public, for once.  Really, £100 is a sight more than <hi rend="italic">Treasure Island</hi> is worth.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">The reason of my <hi rend="italic">dèche</hi>?  Well, if you begin one house, have to desert it, begin another, and are eight months without doing any work, you will be in a <hi rend="italic">dèche</hi> too.  I am not in a <hi rend="italic">dèche</hi>, however; <hi rend="italic">distinguo</hi>—I would fain distinguish; I am rather a swell, but <hi rend="italic">not solvent</hi>.  At a touch the edifice, <hi rend="italic">ædificium</hi>, might collapse.  If my creditors began to babble around me, I would sink with a slow strain of music into the crimson west.  The difficulty in my elegant villa is to find oil, <hi rend="italic">oleum</hi>, for the dam axles.  But I’ve paid my rent until September; and beyond the chemist, the grocer, the baker, the doctor, the gardener, Lloyd’s teacher, and the great thief creditor Death, I can snap my fingers at all men.  Why will people spring bills on you?  I try to make ’em charge me at the moment; they won’t, the money goes, the debt remains.—The Required Play is in the <hi rend="italic">Merry Men</hi>.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Q. E. F.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I thus render honour to your <hi rend="italic">flair</hi>; it came on me of a clap; I do not see it yet beyond a kind of sunset glory.  But it’s there: passion, romance, the picturesque, involved: startling, simple, horrid: a sea-pink in sea-froth!  <hi rend="italic">S’agit de la désenterrer</hi>.  ‘Help!’ cries a buried masterpiece.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Once I see my way to the year’s end, clear, I turn to plays; till then I grind at letters; finish <hi rend="italic">Otto</hi>; write, say, a couple of my <hi rend="italic">Traveller’s Tales</hi>; and then, if all my ships come home, I will attack the drama in earnest.  I cannot mix the skeins.  Thus, though I’m morally sure there is a play in <hi rend="italic">Otto</hi>, I dare not look for it: I shoot straight at the story.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">As a story, a comedy, I think <hi rend="italic">Otto</hi> very well constructed; the echoes are very good, all the sentiments change round, and the points of view are continually, and, I think (if you please), happily contrasted.  None of it is exactly funny, but some of it is smiling.</p>

                     <p rend="justify">It is a pleasant, instructive, and scholarly volume.  The three best being, quite out of sight—Crashaw, Otway, and Etherege.  They are excellent; I hesitate between them; but perhaps Crashaw is the most brilliant</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Your Webster is not my Webster; nor your Herrick my Herrick.  On these matters we must fire a gun to leeward, show our colours, and go by.  Argument is impossible.  They are two of my favourite authors: Herrick above all: I suppose they are two of yours.  Well, Janus-like, they do behold us two with diverse countenances, few features are common to these different avatars; and we can but agree to differ, but still with gratitude to our entertainers, like two guests at the same dinner, one of whom takes clear and one white soup.  By my way of thinking, neither of us need be wrong.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">The other papers are all interesting, adequate, clear, and with a pleasant spice of the romantic.  It is a book you may be well pleased to have so finished, and will do you much good.  The Crashaw is capital: capital; I like the taste of it.  Preface clean and dignified.  The handling throughout workmanlike, with some four or five touches of preciosity, which I regret.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">With my thanks for information, entertainment, and a pleasurable envy here and there.—Yours affectionately,</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">Var</hi>, <hi rend="italic">September</hi> 19, 1883.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">DEAR BOY,—Our letters vigorously cross: you will ere this have received a note to Coggie: God knows what was in it.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">It is strange, a little before the first word you sent me—so late—kindly late, I know and feel—I was thinking in my bed, when I knew you I had six friends—Bob I had by nature; then came the good James Walter—with all his failings—the <hi rend="italic">gentleman</hi> of the lot, alas to sink so low, alas to do so little, but now, thank God, in his quiet rest; next I found Baxter—well do I remember telling Walter I had unearthed ‘a W.S. that I thought would do’—it was in the Academy Lane, and he questioned me as to the Signet’s qualifications; fourth came Simpson; somewhere about the same time, I began to get intimate with Jenkin; last came Colvin.  Then, one black winter afternoon, long Leslie Stephen, in his velvet jacket, met me in the <hi rend="italic">Spec.</hi> by appointment, took me over to the infirmary, and in the crackling, blighting gaslight showed me that old head whose excellent representation I see before me in the photograph.  Now when a man has six friends, to introduce a seventh is usually hopeless.  Yet when you were presented, you took to them and they to you upon the nail.  You must have been a fine fellow; but what a singular fortune I must have had in my six friends that you should take to all.  I don’t know if it is good Latin, most probably not: but this is enscrolled before my eye for Walter: <hi rend="italic">Tandem e nubibus in apricum properat</hi>.  Rest, I suppose, I know, was all that remained; but O to look back, to remember all the mirth, all the kindness, all the humorous limitations and loved defects of that character; to think that he was young with me, sharing that weather-beaten, Fergussonian youth, looking forward through the clouds to the sunburst; and now clean gone from my path, silent—well, well.  This has been a strange awakening.  Last night, when I was alone in the house, with the window open on the lovely still night, I could have sworn he was in the room with me; I could show you the spot; and, what was very curious, I heard his rich laughter, a thing I had not called to mind for I know not how long.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I see his coral waistcoat studs that he wore the first time he dined in my house; I see his attitude, leaning back a little, already with something of a portly air, and laughing internally.  How I admired him!  And now in the West Kirk.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I am trying to write out this haunting bodily sense of absence; besides, what else should I write of?</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Yes, looking back, I think of him as one who was good, though sometimes clouded.  He was the only gentle one of all my friends, save perhaps the other Walter.  And he was certainly the only modest man among the lot.  He never gave himself away; he kept back his secret; there was always a gentle problem behind all.  Dear, dear, what a wreck; and yet how pleasant is the retrospect!  God doeth all things well, though by what strange, solemn, and murderous contrivances!</p>
                     <p rend="justify">It is strange: he was the only man I ever loved who did not habitually interrupt.  The fact draws my own portrait.  And it is one of the many reasons why I count myself honoured by his friendship.  A man like you <hi rend="italic">had</hi> to like me; you could not help yourself; but Ferrier was above me, we were not equals; his true self humoured and smiled paternally upon my failings, even as I humoured and sorrowed over his.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Well, first his mother, then himself, they are gone: ‘in their resting graves.’</p>
                     <p rend="justify">When I come to think of it, I do not know what I said to his sister, and I fear to try again.  Could you send her this?  There is too much both about yourself and me in it; but that, if you do not mind, is but a mark of sincerity.  It would let her know how entirely, in the mind of (I suppose) his oldest friend, the good, true Ferrier obliterates the memory of the other, who was only his ‘lunatic brother.’</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Judge of this for me, and do as you please; anyway, I will try to write to her again; my last was some kind of scrawl that I could not see for crying.  This came upon me, remember, with terrible suddenness; I was surprised by this death; and it is fifteen or sixteen years since first I saw the handsome face in the <hi rend="italic">Spec</hi>.  I made sure, besides, to have died first.  Love to you, your wife, and her sisters.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">—Ever yours, dear boy,</p>
                     <p rend="justify">R. L. S.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I never knew any man so superior to himself as poor James Walter.  The best of him only came as a vision, like Corsica from the Corniche.  He never gave his measure either morally or intellectually.  The curse was on him.  Even his friends did not know him but by fits.  I have passed hours with him when he was so wise, good, and sweet, that I never knew the like of it in any other.  And for a beautiful good humour he had no match.  I remember breaking in upon him once with a whole red-hot story (in my worst manner), pouring words upon him by the hour about some truck not worth an egg that had befallen me; and suddenly, some half hour after, finding that the sweet fellow had some concern of his own of infinitely greater import, that he was patiently and smilingly waiting to consult me on.  It sounds nothing; but the courtesy and the unselfishness were perfect.  It makes me rage to think how few knew him, and how many had the chance to sneer at their better.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Well, he was not wasted, that we know; though if anything looked liker irony than this fitting of a man out with these rich qualities and faculties to be wrecked and aborted from the very stocks, I do not know the name of it.  Yet we see that he has left an influence; the memory of his patient courtesy has often checked me in rudeness; has it not you?</p>
                     <p rend="justify">You can form no idea of how handsome Walter was.  At twenty he was splendid to see; then, too, he had the sense of power in him, and great hopes; he looked forward, ever jesting of course, but he looked to see himself where he had the right to expect.  He believed in himself profoundly; but <hi rend="italic">he never disbelieved in others</hi>.  To the roughest Highland student he always had his fine, kind, open dignity of manner; and a good word behind his back.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">The last time that I saw him before leaving for America—it was a sad blow to both of us.  When he heard I was leaving, and that might be the last time we might meet—it almost was so—he was terribly upset, and came round at once.  We sat late, in Baxter’s empty house, where I was sleeping.  My dear friend Walter Ferrier: O if I had only written to him more! if only one of us in these last days had been well!  But I ever cherished the honour of his friendship, and now when he is gone, I know what I have lost still better.  We live on, meaning to meet; but when the hope is gone, the, pang comes.</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR GOSSE,—It appears a bolt from Transatlantica is necessary to produce four lines from you.  It is not flattering; but as I was always a bad correspondent, ’tis a vice to which I am lenient.  I give you to know, however, that I have already twice (this makes three times) sent you what I please to call a letter, and received from you in return a subterfuge—or nothing. . . .</p>
                     <p rend="justify">My present purpose, however, which must not be postponed, is to ask you to telegraph to the Americans.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">After a summer of good health of a very radiant order, toothache and the death of a very old friend, which came upon me like a thunderclap, have rather shelved my powers.  I stare upon the paper, not write.  I wish I could write like your Sculptors; yet I am well aware that I should not try in that direction.  A certain warmth (tepid enough) and a certain dash of the picturesque are my poor essential qualities; and if I went fooling after the too classical, I might lose even these.  But I envied you that page.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I am, of course, deep in schemes; I was so ever.  Execution alone somewhat halts.  How much do you make per annum, I wonder?  This year, for the first time, I shall pass £300; I may even get halfway to the next milestone.  This seems but a faint remuneration; and the devil of it is, that I manage, with sickness, and moves, and education, and the like, to keep steadily in front of my income.  However, I console myself with this, that if I were anything else under God’s Heaven, and had the same crank health, I should make an even zero.  If I had, with my present knowledge, twelve months of my old health, I would, could, and should do something neat.  As it is, I have to tinker at my things in little sittings; and the rent, or the butcher, or something, is always calling me off to rattle up a pot-boiler.  And then comes a back-set of my health, and I have to twiddle my fingers and play patience.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Well, I do not complain, but I do envy strong health where it is squandered.  Treasure your strength, and may you never learn by experience the profound <hi rend="italic">ennui</hi> and irritation of the shelved artist.  For then, what is life?  All that one has done to make one’s life effective then doubles the itch of inefficiency.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I trust also you may be long without finding out the devil that there is in a bereavement.  After love it is the one great surprise that life preserves for us.  Now I don’t think I can be astonished any more.—Yours affectionately,</p>

                     <p rend="justify">COLVIN, COLVIN, COLVIN,—Yours received; also interesting copy of <hi rend="italic">P. Whistles</hi>.  ‘In the multitude of councillors the Bible declares there is wisdom,’ said my great-uncle, ‘but I have always found in them distraction.’  It is extraordinary how tastes vary: these proofs have been handed about, it appears, and I have had several letters; and—distraction. ‘Æsop: the Miller and the Ass.’  Notes on details:—</p>
                     <p rend="justify">1.  I love the occasional trochaic line; and so did many excellent writers before me.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">2.  If you don’t like ‘A Good Boy,’ I do.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">3.  In ‘Escape at Bedtime,’ I found two suggestions.  ‘Shove’ for ‘above’ is a correction of the press; it was so written.  ‘Twinkled’ is just the error; to the child the stars appear to be there; any word that suggests illusion is a horror.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">4.  I don’t care; I take a different view of the vocative.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">5.  Bewildering and childering are good enough for me.  These are rhymes, jingles; I don’t go for eternity and the three unities.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I will delete some of those condemned, but not all.  I don’t care for the name Penny Whistles; I sent a sheaf to Henley when I sent ’em.  But I’ve forgot the others.  I would just as soon call ’em ‘Rimes for Children’ as anything else.  I am not proud nor particular.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Your remarks on the <hi rend="italic">Black Arrow</hi> are to the point.  I am pleased you liked Crookback; he is a fellow whose hellish energy has always fired my attention.  I wish Shakespeare had written the play after he had learned some of the rudiments of literature and art rather than before.  Some day, I will re-tickle the Sable Missile, and shoot it, <hi rend="italic">moyennant finances</hi>, once more into the air; I can lighten it of much, and devote some more attention to Dick o’ Gloucester.  It’s great sport to write tushery.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">By this I reckon you will have heard of my proposed excursiolorum to the Isles of Greece, the Isles of Greece, and kindred sites.  If the excursiolorum goes on, that is, if <hi rend="italic">moyennant finances</hi> comes off, I shall write to beg you to collect introductiolorums for me.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Distinguo: 1. <hi rend="italic">Silverado</hi> was not written in America, but in Switzerland’s icy mountains.  2. What you read is the bleeding and disembowelled remains of what I wrote.  3. The good stuff is all to come—so I think.  ‘The Sea Fogs,’ ‘The Hunter’s Family,’ ‘Toils and Pleasures’—<hi rend="italic">belles pages</hi>.—Yours ever,</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Ramnugger.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">O!—Seeley is too clever to live, and the book a gem.  But why has he read too much Arnold?  Why will he avoid—obviously avoid—fine writing up to which he has led?  This is a winking, curled-and-oiled, ultra-cultured, Oxford-don sort of an affectation that infuriates my honest soul.  ‘You see’—they say—‘how unbombastic <hi rend="italic">we</hi> are; we come right up to eloquence, and, when it’s hanging on the pen, dammy, we scorn it!’  It is literary Deronda-ism.  If you don’t want the woman, the image, or the phrase, mortify your vanity and avoid the appearance of wanting them.</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR LOW,—. . . Some day or other, in Cassell’s <hi rend="italic">Magazine of Art</hi>, you will see a paper which will interest you, and where your name appears.  It is called ‘Fontainebleau: Village Communities of Artists,’ and the signature of R. L. Stevenson will be found annexed.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Please tell the editor of <hi rend="italic">Manhattan</hi> the following secrets for me: 1<hi rend="italic">st</hi>, That I am a beast; 2<hi rend="italic">nd</hi>, that I owe him a letter; 3<hi rend="italic">rd</hi>, that I have lost his, and cannot recall either his name or address; 4<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, that I am very deep in engagements, which my absurd health makes it hard for me to overtake; but 5<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, that I will bear him in mind; 6<hi rend="italic">th</hi> and last, that I am a brute.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">My address is still the same, and I live in a most sweet corner of the universe, sea and fine hills before me, and a rich variegated plain; and at my back a craggy hill, loaded with vast feudal ruins.  I am very quiet; a person passing by my door half startles me; but I enjoy the most aromatic airs, and at night the most wonderful view into a moonlit garden.  By day this garden fades into nothing, overpowered by its surroundings and the luminous distance; but at night and when the moon is out, that garden, the arbour, the flight of stairs that mount the artificial hillock, the plumed blue gum-trees that hang trembling, become the very skirts of Paradise.  Angels I know frequent it; and it thrills all night with the flutes of silence.  Damn that garden;—and by day it is gone.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Continue to testify boldly against realism.  Down with Dagon, the fish god!  All art swings down towards imitation, in these days, fatally.  But the man who loves art with wisdom sees the joke; it is the lustful that tremble and respect her ladyship; but the honest and romantic lovers of the Muse can see a joke and sit down to laugh with Apollo.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">The prospect of your return to Europe is very agreeable; and I was pleased by what you said about your parents.  One of my oldest friends died recently, and this has given me new thoughts of death.  Up to now I had rather thought of him as a mere personal enemy of my own; but now that I see him hunting after my friends, he looks altogether darker.  My own father is not well; and Henley, of whom you must have heard me speak, is in a questionable state of health.  These things are very solemn, and take some of the colour out of life.  It is a great thing, after all, to be a man of reasonable honour and kindness.  Do you remember once consulting me in Paris whether you had not better sacrifice honesty to art; and how, after much confabulation, we agreed that your art would suffer if you did?  We decided better than we knew.  In this strange welter where we live, all hangs together by a million filaments; and to do reasonably well by others, is the first prerequisite of art.  Art is a virtue; and if I were the man I should be, my art would rise in the proportion of my life.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">If you were privileged to give some happiness to your parents, I know your art will gain by it.  <hi rend="italic">By God</hi>, <hi rend="italic">it will</hi>!  <hi rend="italic">Sic subscribitur</hi>,</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR BOB,—Yes, I got both your letters at Lyons, but have been since then decading in several steps Toothache; fever; Ferrier’s death; lung.  Now it is decided I am to leave to-morrow, penniless, for Nice to see Dr. Williams.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I was much struck by your last.  I have written a breathless note on Realism for Henley; a fifth part of the subject, hurriedly touched, which will show you how my thoughts are driving.  You are now at last beginning to think upon the problems of executive, plastic art, for you are now for the first time attacking them.  Hitherto you have spoken and thought of two things—technique and the <hi rend="italic">ars artium</hi>, or common background of all arts.  Studio work is the real touch.  That is the genial error of the present French teaching.  Realism I regard as a mere question of method.  The ‘brown foreground,’ ‘old mastery,’ and the like, ranking with villanelles, as technical sports and pastimes.  Real art, whether ideal or realistic, addresses precisely the same feeling, and seeks the same qualities—significance or charm.  And the same—very same—inspiration is only methodically differentiated according as the artist is an arrant realist or an arrant idealist.  Each, by his own method, seeks to save and perpetuate the same significance or charm; the one by suppressing, the other by forcing, detail.  All other idealism is the brown foreground over again, and hence only art in the sense of a game, like cup and ball.  All other realism is not art at all—but not at all.  It is, then, an insincere and showy handicraft.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Were you to re-read some Balzac, as I have been doing, it would greatly help to clear your eyes.  He was a man who never found his method.  An inarticulate Shakespeare, smothered under forcible-feeble detail.  It is astounding to the riper mind how bad he is, how feeble, how untrue, how tedious; and, of course, when he surrendered to his temperament, how good and powerful.  And yet never plain nor clear.  He could not consent to be dull, and thus became so.  He would leave nothing undeveloped, and thus drowned out of sight of land amid the multitude of crying and incongruous details.  There is but one art—to omit!  O if I knew how to omit, I would ask no other knowledge.  A man who knew how to omit would make an <hi rend="italic">Iliad</hi> of a daily paper.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Your definition of seeing is quite right.  It is the first part of omission to be partly blind.  Artistic sight is judicious blindness.  Sam Bough <ref target="#1730040348670317495_622-h-3.htm.xhtml#footnote289">[289]</ref> must have been a jolly blind old boy.  He would turn a corner, look for one-half or quarter minute, and then say, ‘This’ll do, lad.’  Down he sat, there and then, with whole artistic plan, scheme of colour, and the like, and begin by laying a foundation of powerful and seemingly incongruous colour on the block.  He saw, not the scene, but the water-colour sketch.  Every artist by sixty should so behold nature.  Where does he learn that?  In the studio, I swear.  He goes to nature for facts, relations, values—material; as a man, before writing a historical novel, reads up memoirs.  But it is not by reading memoirs that he has learned the selective criterion.  He has learned that in the practice of his art; and he will never learn it well, but when disengaged from the ardent struggle of immediate representation, of realistic and <hi rend="italic">ex facto</hi> art.  He learns it in the crystallisation of day-dreams; in changing, not in copying, fact; in the pursuit of the ideal, not in the study of nature.  These temples of art are, as you say, inaccessible to the realistic climber.  It is not by looking at the sea that you get</p>
                     <p rend="justify">‘The multitudinous seas incarnadine,’</p>
                     <p rend="justify">nor by looking at Mont Blanc that you find</p>
                     <p rend="justify">‘And visited all night by troops of stars.’</p>
                     <p rend="justify">A kind of ardour of the blood is the mother of all this; and according as this ardour is swayed by knowledge and seconded by craft, the art expression flows clear, and significance and charm, like a moon rising, are born above the barren juggle of mere symbols.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">The painter must study more from nature than the man of words.  But why?  Because literature deals with men’s business and passions which, in the game of life, we are irresistibly obliged to study; but painting with relations of light, and colour, and significances, and form, which, from the immemorial habit of the race, we pass over with an unregardful eye.  Hence this crouching upon camp-stools, and these crusts. <ref target="#1730040348670317495_622-h-3.htm.xhtml#footnote290">[290]</ref>  But neither one nor other is a part of art, only preliminary studies.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I want you to help me to get people to understand that realism is a method, and only methodic in its consequences; when the realist is an artist, that is, and supposing the idealist with whom you compare him to be anything but a <hi rend="italic">farceur</hi> and a <hi rend="italic">dilettante</hi>.  The two schools of working do, and should, lead to the choice of different subjects.  But that is a consequence, not a cause.  See my chaotic note, which will appear, I fancy, in November in Henley’s sheet.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Poor Ferrier, it bust me horrid.  He was, after you, the oldest of my friends.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I am now very tired, and will go to bed having prelected freely.  Fanny will finish.</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR FATHER,—I have just lunched; the day is exquisite, the air comes though the open window rich with odour, and I am by no means spiritually minded.  Your letter, however, was very much valued, and has been read oftener than once.  What you say about yourself I was glad to hear; a little decent resignation is not only becoming a Christian, but is likely to be excellent for the health of a Stevenson.  To fret and fume is undignified, suicidally foolish, and theologically unpardonable; we are here not to make, but to tread predestined, pathways; we are the foam of a wave, and to preserve a proper equanimity is not merely the first part of submission to God, but the chief of possible kindnesses to those about us.  I am lecturing myself, but you also.  To do our best is one part, but to wash our hands smilingly of the consequence is the next part, of any sensible virtue.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I have come, for the moment, to a pause in my moral works; for I have many irons in the fire, and I wish to finish something to bring coin before I can afford to go on with what I think doubtfully to be a duty.  It is a most difficult work; a touch of the parson will drive off those I hope to influence; a touch of overstrained laxity, besides disgusting, like a grimace, may do harm.  Nothing that I have ever seen yet speaks directly and efficaciously to young men; and I do hope I may find the art and wisdom to fill up a gap.  The great point, as I see it, is to ask as little as possible, and meet, if it may be, every view or absence of view; and it should be, must be, easy.  Honesty is the one desideratum; but think how hard a one to meet.  I think all the time of Ferrier and myself; these are the pair that I address.  Poor Ferrier, so much a better man than I, and such a temporal wreck.  But the thing of which we must divest our minds is to look partially upon others; all is to be viewed; and the creature judged, as he must be by his Creator, not dissected through a prism of morals, but in the unrefracted ray.  So seen, and in relation to the almost omnipotent surroundings, who is to distinguish between F. and such a man as Dr. Candlish, or between such a man as David Hume and such an one as Robert Burns?  To compare my poor and good Walter with myself is to make me startle; he, upon all grounds above the merely expedient, was the nobler being.  Yet wrecked utterly ere the full age of manhood; and the last skirmishes so well fought, so humanly useless, so pathetically brave, only the leaps of an expiring lamp.  All this is a very pointed instance.  It shuts the mouth.  I have learned more, in some ways, from him than from any other soul I ever met; and he, strange to think, was the best gentleman, in all kinder senses, that I ever knew.—Ever your affectionate son,</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR LOW,—<hi rend="italic">C’est d’un bon camarade</hi>; and I am much obliged to you for your two letters and the inclosure.  Times are a lityle changed with all of us since the ever memorable days of Lavenue: hallowed be his name! hallowed his old Fleury!—of which you did not see—I think—as I did—the glorious apotheosis: advanced on a Tuesday to three francs, on the Thursday to six, and on Friday swept off, holus bolus, for the proprietor’s private consumption.  Well, we had the start of that proprietor.  Many a good bottle came our way, and was, I think, worthily made welcome.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I am pleased that Mr. Gilder should like my literature; and I ask you particularly to thank Mr. Bunner (have I the name right?) for his notice, which was of that friendly, headlong sort that really pleases an author like what the French call a ‘shake-hands.’  It pleased me the more coming from the States, where I have met not much recognition, save from the buccaneers, and above all from pirates who misspell my name.  I saw my book advertised in a number of the <hi rend="italic">Critic</hi> as the work of one R. L. Stephenson; and, I own, I boiled.  It is so easy to know the name of the man whose book you have stolen; for there it is, at full length, on the title-page of your booty.  But no, damn him, not he!  He calls me Stephenson.  These woes I only refer to by the way, as they set a higher value on the <hi rend="italic">Century</hi> notice.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I am now a person with an established ill-health—a wife—a dog possessed with an evil, a Gadarene spirit—a chalet on a hill, looking out over the Mediterranean—a certain reputation—and very obscure finances.  Otherwise, very much the same, I guess; and were a bottle of Fleury a thing to be obtained, capable of developing theories along with a fit spirit even as of yore.  Yet I now draw near to the Middle Ages; nearly three years ago, that fatal Thirty struck; and yet the great work is not yet done—not yet even conceived.  But so, as one goes on, the wood seems to thicken, the footpath to narrow, and the House Beautiful on the hill’s summit to draw further and further away.  We learn, indeed, to use our means; but only to learn, along with it, the paralysing knowledge that these means are only applicable to two or three poor commonplace motives.  Eight years ago, if I could have slung ink as I can now, I should have thought myself well on the road after Shakespeare; and now—I find I have only got a pair of walking-shoes and not yet begun to travel.  And art is still away there on the mountain summit.  But I need not continue; for, of course, this is your story just as much as it is mine; and, strange to think, it was Shakespeare’s too, and Beethoven’s, and Phidias’s.  It is a blessed thing that, in this forest of art, we can pursue our wood-lice and sparrows, <hi rend="italic">and not catch them</hi>, with almost the same fervour of exhilaration as that with which Sophocles hunted and brought down the Mastodon.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Tell me something of your work, and your wife.—My dear fellow, I am yours ever,</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR LAD,—. . .  Of course, my seamanship is jimmy: did I not beseech you I know not how often to find me an ancient mariner—and you, whose own wife’s own brother is one of the ancientest, did nothing for me?  As for my seamen, did Runciman ever know eighteenth century buccaneers?  No?  Well, no more did I.  But I have known and sailed with seamen too, and lived and eaten with them; and I made my put-up shot in no great ignorance, but as a put-up thing has to be made, <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> to be coherent and picturesque, and damn the expense.  Are they fairly lively on the wires?  Then, favour me with your tongues.  Are they wooden, and dim, and no sport?  Then it is I that am silent, otherwise not.  The work, strange as it may sound in the ear, is not a work of realism.  The next thing I shall hear is that the etiquette is wrong in Otto’s Court!  With a warrant, and I mean it to be so, and the whole matter never cost me half a thought.  I make these paper people to please myself, and Skelt, and God Almighty, and with no ulterior purpose.  Yet am I mortal myself; for, as I remind you, I begged for a supervising mariner.  However, my heart is in the right place.  I have been to sea, but I never crossed the threshold of a court; and the courts shall be the way I want ’em.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I’m glad to think I owe you the review that pleased me best of all the reviews I ever had; the one I liked best before that was —’s on the <hi rend="italic">Arabians</hi>.  These two are the flowers of the collection, according to me.  To live reading such reviews and die eating ortolans—sich is my aspiration.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Whenever you come you will be equally welcome.  I am trying to finish <hi rend="italic">Otto</hi> ere you shall arrive, so as to take and be able to enjoy a well-earned—O yes, a well-earned—holiday.  Longman fetched by Otto: is it a spoon or a spoilt horn?  Momentous, if the latter; if the former, a spoon to dip much praise and pudding, and to give, I do think, much pleasure.  The last part, now in hand, much smiles upon me.—Ever yours,</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR MOTHER,—You must not blame me too much for my silence; I am over head and ears in work, and do not know what to do first.  I have been hard at <hi rend="italic">Otto</hi>, hard at <hi rend="italic">Silverado</hi> proofs, which I have worked over again to a tremendous extent; cutting, adding, rewriting, until some of the worst chapters of the original are now, to my mind, as good as any.  I was the more bound to make it good, as I had such liberal terms; it’s not for want of trying if I have failed.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I got your letter on my birthday; indeed, that was how I found it out about three in the afternoon, when postie comes.  Thank you for all you said.  As for my wife, that was the best investment ever made by man; but ‘in our branch of the family’ we seem to marry well.  I, considering my piles of work, am wonderfully well; I have not been so busy for I know not how long.  I hope you will send me the money I asked however, as I am not only penniless, but shall remain so in all human probability for some considerable time.  I have got in the mass of my expectations; and the £100 which is to float us on the new year can not come due till <hi rend="italic">Silverado</hi> is all ready; I am delaying it myself for the moment; then will follow the binders and the travellers and an infinity of other nuisances; and only at the last, the jingling-tingling.</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR HENRIETTA,—Certainly; who else would they be?  More by token, on that particular occasion, you were sailing under the title of Princess Royal; I, after a furious contest, under that of Prince Alfred; and Willie, still a little sulky, as the Prince of Wales.  We were all in a buck basket about half-way between the swing and the gate; and I can still see the Pirate Squadron heave in sight upon the weather bow.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I wrote a piece besides on Giant Bunker; but I was not happily inspired, and it is condemned.  Perhaps I’ll try again; he was a horrid fellow, Giant Bunker! and some of my happiest hours were passed in pursuit of him.  You were a capital fellow to play: how few there were who could!  None better than yourself.  I shall never forget some of the days at Bridge of Allan; they were one golden dream.  See ‘A Good Boy’ in the <hi rend="italic">Penny Whistles</hi>, much of the sentiment of which is taken direct from one evening at B. of A. when we had had a great play with the little Glasgow girl.  Hallowed be that fat book of fairy tales!  Do you remember acting the Fair One with Golden Locks?  What a romantic drama!  Generally speaking, whenever I think of play, it is pretty certain that you will come into my head.  I wrote a paper called ‘Child’s Play’ once, where, I believe, you or Willie would recognise things. . . .</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Surely Willie is just the man to marry; and if his wife wasn’t a happy woman, I think I could tell her who was to blame.  Is there no word of it?  Well, these things are beyond arrangement; and the wind bloweth where it listeth—which, I observe, is generally towards the west in Scotland.  Here it prefers a south-easterly course, and is called the Mistral—usually with an adjective in front.  But if you will remember my yesterday’s toothache and this morning’s crick, you will be in a position to choose an adjective for yourself.  Not that the wind is unhealthy; only when it comes strong, it is both very high and very cold, which makes it the d-v-l.  But as I am writing to a lady, I had better avoid this topic; winds requiring a great scope of language.</p>

                     <p rend="justify">DEAR MISS FERRIER,—Many thanks for the photograph.  It is—well, it is like most photographs.  The sun is an artist of too much renown; and, at any rate, we who knew Walter ‘in the brave days of old’ will be difficult to please.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I was inexpressibly touched to get a letter from some lawyers as to some money.  I have never had any account with my friends; some have gained and some lost; and I should feel there was something dishonest in a partial liquidation even if I could recollect the facts, <hi rend="italic">which I cannot</hi>.  But the fact of his having put aside this memorandum touched me greatly.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">The mystery of his life is great.  Our chemist in this place, who had been at Malvern, recognised the picture.  You may remember Walter had a romantic affection for all pharmacies? and the bottles in the window were for him a poem?  He said once that he knew no pleasure like driving through a lamplit city, waiting for the chemists to go by.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">All these things return now.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">He had a pretty full translation of Schiller’s <hi rend="italic">Æsthetic Letters</hi>, which we read together, as well as the second part of <hi rend="italic">Faust</hi>, in Gladstone Terrace, he helping me with the German.  There is no keepsake I should more value than the MS. of that translation.  They were the best days I ever had with him, little dreaming all would so soon be over.  It needs a blow like this to convict a man of mortality and its burthen.  I always thought I should go by myself; not to survive.  But now I feel as if the earth were undermined, and all my friends have lost one thickness of reality since that one passed.  Those are happy who can take it otherwise; with that I found things all beginning to dislimn.  Here we have no abiding city, and one felt as though he had—and O too much acted.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">But if you tell me, he did not feel my silence.  However, he must have done so; and my guilt is irreparable now.  I thank God at least heartily that he did not resent it.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Please remember me to Sir Alexander and Lady Grant, to whose care I will address this.  When next I am in Edinburgh I will take flowers, alas! to the West Kirk.  Many a long hour we passed in graveyards, the man who has gone and I—or rather not that man—but the beautiful, genial, witty youth who so betrayed him.—Dear Miss Ferrier, I am yours most sincerely,</p>

I was much pleased with what you send about my work.  Ill-health is a great handicapper in the race.  I have never at command that press of spirits that are necessary to strike out a thing red-hot.  <hi rend="italic">Silverado</hi> is an example of stuff worried and pawed about, God knows how often, in poor health, and you can see for yourself the result: good pages, an imperfect fusion, a certain languor of the whole.  Not, in short, art.  I have told Roberts to send you a copy of the book when it appears, where there are some fair passages that will be new to you.  My brief romance, <hi rend="italic">Prince Otto</hi>—far my most difficult adventure up to now—is near an end.  I have still one chapter to write <hi rend="italic">de fond en comble</hi>, and three or four to strengthen or recast.  The rest is done.  I do not know if I have made a spoon, or only spoiled a horn; but I am tempted to hope the first.  If the present bargain hold, it will not see the light of day for some thirteen months.  Then I shall be glad to know how it strikes you.  There is a good deal of stuff in it, both dramatic and, I think, poetic; and the story is not like these purposeless fables of to-day, but is, at least, intended to stand <hi rend="italic">firm</hi> upon a base of philosophy—or morals—as you please.  It has been long gestated, and is wrought with care.  <hi rend="italic">Enfin</hi>, <hi rend="italic">nous verrons</hi>.  My labours have this year for the first time been rewarded with upwards of £350; that of itself, so base we are! encourages me; and the better tenor of my health yet more.—Remember me to Mrs. Low, and believe me, yours most sincerely,</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR FATHER,—I do not know which of us is to blame; I suspect it is you this time.  The last accounts of you were pretty good, I was pleased to see; I am, on the whole, very well—suffering a little still from my fever and liver complications, but better.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I have just finished re-reading a book, which I counsel you above all things <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to read, as it has made me very ill, and would make you worse—Lockhart’s <hi rend="italic">Scott</hi>.  It is worth reading, as all things are from time to time that keep us nose to nose with fact; though I think such reading may be abused, and that a great deal of life is better spent in reading of a light and yet chivalrous strain.  Thus, no Waverley novel approaches in power, blackness, bitterness, and moral elevation to the diary and Lockhart’s narrative of the end; and yet the Waverley novels are better reading for every day than the Life.  You may take a tonic daily, but not phlebotomy.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">The great double danger of taking life too easily, and taking it too hard, how difficult it is to balance that!  But we are all too little inclined to faith; we are all, in our serious moments, too much inclined to forget that all are sinners, and fall justly by their faults, and therefore that we have no more to do with that than with the thunder-cloud; only to trust, and do our best, and wear as smiling a face as may be for others and ourselves.  But there is no royal road among this complicated business.  Hegel the German got the best word of all philosophy with his antinomies: the contrary of everything is its postulate.  That is, of course, grossly expressed, but gives a hint of the idea, which contains a great deal of the mysteries of religion, and a vast amount of the practical wisdom of life.  For your part, there is no doubt as to your duty—to take things easy and be as happy as you can, for your sake, and my mother’s, and that of many besides.  Excuse this sermon.—Ever your loving son,</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR MOTHER,—I give my father up.  I give him a parable: that the Waverley novels are better reading for every day than the tragic Life.  And he takes it backside foremost, and shakes his head, and is gloomier than ever.  Tell him that I give him up.  I don’t want no such a parent.  This is not the man for my money.  I do not call that by the name of religion which fills a man with bile.  I write him a whole letter, bidding him beware of extremes, and telling him that his gloom is gallows-worthy; and I get back an answer—Perish the thought of it.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Here am I on the threshold of another year, when, according to all human foresight, I should long ago have been resolved into my elements; here am I, who you were persuaded was born to disgrace you—and, I will do you the justice to add, on no such insufficient grounds—no very burning discredit when all is done; here am I married, and the marriage recognised to be a blessing of the first order, A1 at Lloyd’s.  There is he, at his not first youth, able to take more exercise than I at thirty-three, and gaining a stone’s weight, a thing of which I am incapable.  There are you; has the man no gratitude?  There is Smeoroch <ref target="#1730040348670317495_622-h-3.htm.xhtml#footnote303">[303]</ref>: is he blind?  Tell him from me that all this is</p>

                     <p rend="justify">I will think more of his prayers when I see in him a spirit of <hi rend="italic">praise</hi>.  Piety is a more childlike and happy attitude than he admits.  Martha, Martha, do you hear the knocking at the door?  But Mary was happy.  Even the Shorter Catechism, not the merriest epitome of religion, and a work exactly as pious although not quite so true as the multiplication table—even that dry-as-dust epitome begins with a heroic note.  What is man’s chief end?  Let him study that; and ask himself if to refuse to enjoy God’s kindest gifts is in the spirit indicated.  Up, Dullard!  It is better service to enjoy a novel than to mump.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I have been most unjust to the Shorter Catechism, I perceive.  I wish to say that I keenly admire its merits as a performance; and that all that was in my mind was its peculiarly unreligious and unmoral texture; from which defect it can never, of course, exercise the least influence on the minds of children.  But they learn fine style and some austere thinking unconsciously.—Ever your loving son,</p>

                     <p rend="justify">When I think of how last year began, after four months of sickness and idleness, all my plans gone to water, myself starting alone, a kind of spectre, for Nice—should I not be grateful?  Come, let us sing unto the Lord!</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Nor should I forget the expected visit, but I will not believe in that till it befall; I am no cultivator of disappointments, ’tis a herb that does not grow in my garden; but I get some good crops both of remorse and gratitude.  The last I can recommend to all gardeners; it grows best in shiny weather, but once well grown, is very hardy; it does not require much labour; only that the husbandman should smoke his pipe about the flower-plots and admire God’s pleasant wonders.  Winter green (otherwise known as Resignation, or the ‘false gratitude plant’) springs in much the same soil; is little hardier, if at all; and requires to be so dug about and dunged, that there is little margin left for profit.  The variety known as the Black Winter green (H. V. Stevensoniana) is rather for ornament than profit.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">‘John, do you see that bed of resignation?’—‘It’s doin’ bravely, sir.’—‘John, I will not have it in my garden; it flatters not the eye and comforts not the stomach; root it out.’—‘Sir, I ha’e seen o’ them that rase as high as nettles; gran’ plants!’—‘What then?  Were they as tall as alps, if still unsavoury and bleak, what matters it?  Out with it, then; and in its place put Laughter and a Good Conceit (that capital home evergreen), and a bush of Flowering Piety—but see it be the flowering sort—the other species is no ornament to any gentleman’s Back Garden.’</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR S. C.,—You will already have received a not very sane note from me; so your patience was rewarded—may I say, your patient silence?  However, now comes a letter, which on receipt, I thus acknowledge.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I have already expressed myself as to the political aspect.  About Grahame, I feel happier; it does seem to have been really a good, neat, honest piece of work.  We do not seem to be so badly off for commanders: Wolseley and Roberts, and this pile of Woods, Stewarts, Alisons, Grahames, and the like.  Had we but ONE statesman on any side of the house!</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Two chapters of <hi rend="italic">Otto</hi> do remain: one to rewrite, one to create; and I am not yet able to tackle them.  For me it is my chief o’ works; hence probably not so for others, since it only means that I have here attacked the greatest difficulties.  But some chapters towards the end: three in particular—I do think come off.  I find them stirring, dramatic, and not unpoetical.  We shall see, however; as like as not, the effort will be more obvious than the success.  For, of course, I strung myself hard to carry it out.  The next will come easier, and possibly be more popular.  I believe in the covering of much paper, each time with a definite and not too difficult artistic purpose; and then, from time to time, drawing oneself up and trying, in a superior effort, to combine the facilities thus acquired or improved.  Thus one progresses.  But, mind, it is very likely that the big effort, instead of being the masterpiece, may be the blotted copy, the gymnastic exercise.  This no man can tell; only the brutal and licentious public, snouting in Mudie’s wash-trough, can return a dubious answer.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I am to-day, thanks to a pure heaven and a beneficent, loud-talking, antiseptic mistral, on the high places as to health and spirits.  Money holds out wonderfully.  Fanny has gone for a drive to certain meadows which are now one sheet of jonquils: sea-bound meadows, the thought of which may freshen you in Bloomsbury.  ‘Ye have been fresh and fair, Ye have been filled with flowers’—I fear I misquote.  Why do people babble?  Surely Herrick, in his true vein, is superior to Martial himself, though Martial is a very pretty poet.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Did you ever read St. Augustine?  The first chapters of the <hi rend="italic">Confessions</hi> are marked by a commanding genius.  Shakespearian in depth.  I was struck dumb, but, alas! when you begin to wander into controversy, the poet drops out.  His description of infancy is most seizing.  And how is this: ‘Sed majorum nugae negotia vocantur; puerorum autem talia cum sint puniuntur a majoribus.’  Which is quite after the heart of R. L. S.  See also his splendid passage about the ‘luminosus limes amicitiae’ and the ‘nebulae de limosa concupiscentia carnis’; going on ‘<hi rend="italic">Utrumque</hi> in confuso aestuabat et rapiebat imbecillam aetatem per abrupta cupiditatum.’  That ‘Utrumque’ is a real contribution to life’s science.  Lust <hi rend="italic">alone</hi> is but a pigmy; but it never, or rarely, attacks us single-handed.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Do you ever read (to go miles off, indeed) the incredible Barbey d’Aurevilly?  A psychological Poe—to be for a moment Henley.  I own with pleasure I prefer him with all his folly, rot, sentiment, and mixed metaphors, to the whole modern school in France.  It makes me laugh when it’s nonsense; and when he gets an effect (though it’s still nonsense and mere Poëry, not poesy) it wakens me.  <hi rend="italic">Ce qui ne meurt pas</hi> nearly killed me with laughing, and left me—well, it left me very nearly admiring the old ass.  At least, it’s the kind of thing one feels one couldn’t do.  The dreadful moonlight, when they all three sit silent in the room—by George, sir, it’s imagined—and the brief scene between the husband and wife is all there.  <hi rend="italic">Quant au fond</hi>, the whole thing, of course, is a fever dream, and worthy of eternal laughter.  Had the young man broken stones, and the two women been hard-working honest prostitutes, there had been an end of the whole immoral and baseless business: you could at least have respected them in that case.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I also read <hi rend="italic">Petronius Arbiter</hi>, which is a rum work, not so immoral as most modern works, but singularly silly.  I tackled some Tacitus too.  I got them with a dreadful French crib on the same page with the text, which helps me along and drives me mad.  The French do not even try to translate.  They try to be much more classical than the classics, with astounding results of barrenness and tedium.  Tacitus, I fear, was too solid for me.  I liked the war part; but the dreary intriguing at Rome was too much.</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR MR. DICK,—I have been a great while owing you a letter; but I am not without excuses, as you have heard.  I overworked to get a piece of work finished before I had my holiday, thinking to enjoy it more; and instead of that, the machinery near hand came sundry in my hands! like Murdie’s uniform.  However, I am now, I think, in a fair way of recovery; I think I was made, what there is of me, of whipcord and thorn-switches; surely I am tough!  But I fancy I shall not overdrive again, or not so long.  It is my theory that work is highly beneficial, but that it should, if possible, and certainly for such partially broken-down instruments as the thing I call my body, be taken in batches, with a clear break and breathing space between.  I always do vary my work, laying one thing aside to take up another, not merely because I believe it rests the brain, but because I have found it most beneficial to the result.  Reading, Bacon says, makes a full man, but what makes me full on any subject is to banish it for a time from all my thoughts.  However, what I now propose is, out of every quarter, to work two months’ and rest the third.  I believe I shall get more done, as I generally manage, on my present scheme, to have four months’ impotent illness and two of imperfect health—one before, one after, I break down.  This, at least, is not an economical division of the year.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I re-read the other day that heartbreaking book, the <hi rend="italic">Life of Scott</hi>.  One should read such works now and then, but O, not often.  As I live, I feel more and more that literature should be cheerful and brave-spirited, even if it cannot be made beautiful and pious and heroic.  We wish it to be a green place; the <hi rend="italic">Waverley Novels</hi> are better to re-read than the over-true life, fine as dear Sir Walter was.  The Bible, in most parts, is a cheerful book; it is our little piping theologies, tracts, and sermons that are dull and dowie; and even the Shorter Catechism, which is scarcely a work of consolation, opens with the best and shortest and completest sermon ever written—upon Man’s chief end.—Believe me, my dear Mr. Dick, very sincerely yours,</p>

                     <p rend="justify">
                        <hi rend="italic">P.S.</hi>—You see I have changed my hand.  I was threatened apparently with scrivener’s cramp, and at any rate had got to write so small, that the revisal of my MS. tried my eyes, hence my signature alone remains upon the old model; for it appears that if I changed that, I should be cut off from my ‘vivers.’</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR MONKHOUSE,—You see with what promptitude I plunge into correspondence; but the truth is, I am condemned to a complete inaction, stagnate dismally, and love a letter.  Yours, which would have been welcome at any time, was thus doubly precious.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Dover sounds somewhat shiveringly in my ears.  You should see the weather <hi rend="italic">I</hi> have—cloudless, clear as crystal, with just a punkah-draft of the most aromatic air, all pine and gum tree.  You would be ashamed of Dover; you would scruple to refer, sir, to a spot so paltry.  To be idle at Dover is a strange pretension; pray, how do you warm yourself?  If I were there I should grind knives or write blank verse, or—  But at least you do not bathe?  It is idle to deny it: I have—I may say I nourish—a growing jealousy of the robust, large-legged, healthy Britain-dwellers, patient of grog, scorners of the timid umbrella, innocuously breathing fog: all which I once was, and I am ashamed to say liked it.  How ignorant is youth! grossly rolling among unselected pleasures; and how nobler, purer, sweeter, and lighter, to sip the choice tonic, to recline in the luxurious invalid chair, and to tread, well-shawled, the little round of the constitutional.  Seriously, do you like to repose?  Ye gods, I hate it.  I never rest with any acceptation; I do not know what people mean who say they like sleep and that damned bedtime which, since long ere I was breeched, has rung a knell to all my day’s doings and beings.  And when a man, seemingly sane, tells me he has ‘fallen in love with stagnation,’ I can only say to him, ‘You will never be a Pirate!’  This may not cause any regret to Mrs. Monkhouse; but in your own soul it will clang hollow—think of it!  Never!  After all boyhood’s aspirations and youth’s immoral day-dreams, you are condemned to sit down, grossly draw in your chair to the fat board, and be a beastly Burgess till you die.  Can it be?  Is there not some escape, some furlough from the Moral Law, some holiday jaunt contrivable into a Better Land?  Shall we never shed blood?  This prospect is too grey.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">‘Here lies a man who never did<lb/>Anything but what he was bid;<lb/>Who lived his life in paltry ease,<lb/>And died of commonplace disease.’</p>
                     <p rend="justify">To confess plainly, I had intended to spend my life (or any leisure I might have from Piracy upon the high seas) as the leader of a great horde of irregular cavalry, devastating whole valleys.  I can still, looking back, see myself in many favourite attitudes; signalling for a boat from my pirate ship with a pocket-handkerchief, I at the jetty end, and one or two of my bold blades keeping the crowd at bay; or else turning in the saddle to look back at my whole command (some five thousand strong) following me at the hand-gallop up the road out of the burning valley: this last by moonlight.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">
                        <hi rend="italic">Et point du tout</hi>.  I am a poor scribe, and have scarce broken a commandment to mention, and have recently dined upon cold veal!  As for you (who probably had some ambitions), I hear of you living at Dover, in lodgings, like the beasts of the field.  But in heaven, when we get there, we shall have a good time, and see some real carnage.  For heaven is—must be—that great Kingdom of Antinomia, which Lamb saw dimly adumbrated in the <hi rend="italic">Country Wife</hi>, where the worm which never dies (the conscience) peacefully expires, and the sinner lies down beside the Ten Commandments.  Till then, here a sheer hulk lies poor Tom Bowling, with neither health nor vice for anything more spirited than procrastination, which I may well call the Consolation Stakes of Wickedness; and by whose diligent practice, without the least amusement to ourselves, we can rob the orphan and bring down grey hairs with sorrow to the dust.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">This astonishing gush of nonsense I now hasten to close, envelope, and expedite to Shakespeare’s Cliff.  Remember me to Shakespeare, and believe me, yours very sincerely,</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR GOSSE,—Your office—office is profanely said—your bower upon the leads is divine.  Have you, like Pepys, ‘the right to fiddle’ there?  I see you mount the companion, barbiton in hand, and, fluttered about by city sparrows, pour forth your spirit in a voluntary.  Now when the spring begins, you must lay in your flowers: how do you say about a potted hawthorn?  Would it bloom?  Wallflower is a choice pot-herb; lily-of-the-valley, too, and carnation, and Indian cress trailed about the window, is not only beautiful by colour, but the leaves are good to eat.  I recommend thyme and rosemary for the aroma, which should not be left upon one side; they are good quiet growths.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">On one of your tables keep a great map spread out; a chart is still better—it takes one further—the havens with their little anchors, the rocks, banks, and soundings, are adorably marine; and such furniture will suit your ship-shape habitation.  I wish I could see those cabins; they smile upon me with the most intimate charm.  From your leads, do you behold St. Paul’s?  I always like to see the Foolscap; it is London <hi rend="italic">per se</hi> and no spot from which it is visible is without romance.  Then it is good company for the man of letters, whose veritable nursing Pater-Noster is so near at hand.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I am all at a standstill; as idle as a painted ship, but not so pretty.  My romance, which has so nearly butchered me in the writing, not even finished; though so near, thank God, that a few days of tolerable strength will see the roof upon that structure.  I have worked very hard at it, and so do not expect any great public favour.  <hi rend="italic">In moments of effort</hi>, <hi rend="italic">one learns to do the easy things that people like</hi>.  There is the golden maxim; thus one should strain and then play, strain again and play again.  The strain is for us, it educates; the play is for the reader, and pleases.  Do you not feel so?  We are ever threatened by two contrary faults: both deadly.  To sink into what my forefathers would have called ‘rank conformity,’ and to pour forth cheap replicas, upon the one hand; upon the other, and still more insidiously present, to forget that art is a diversion and a decoration, that no triumph or effort is of value, nor anything worth reaching except charm.—Yours affectionately,</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR MISS FERRIER,—Are you really going to fall us?  This seems a dreadful thing.  My poor wife, who is not well off for friends on this bare coast, has been promising herself, and I have been promising her, a rare acquisition.  And now Miss Burn has failed, and you utter a very doubtful note.  You do not know how delightful this place is, nor how anxious we are for a visit.  Look at the names: ‘The Solitude’—is that romantic?  The palm-trees?—how is that for the gorgeous East?  ‘Var’? the name of a river—‘the quiet waters by’!  ’Tis true, they are in another department, and consist of stones and a biennial spate; but what a music, what a plash of brooks, for the imagination!  We have hills; we have skies; the roses are putting forth, as yet sparsely; the meadows by the sea are one sheet of jonquils; the birds sing as in an English May—for, considering we are in France and serve up our song-birds, I am ashamed to say, on a little field of toast and with a sprig of thyme (my own receipt) in their most innocent and now unvocal bellies—considering all this, we have a wonderfully fair wood-music round this Solitude of ours.  What can I say more?—All this awaits you.  <hi rend="italic">Kennst du das Land</hi>, in short.—Your sincere friend,</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR LOW,—The blind man in these sprawled lines sends greeting.  I have been ill, as perhaps the papers told you.  The news—‘great news—glorious news—sec-ond ed-ition!’—went the round in England.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Anyway, I now thank you for your pictures, which, particularly the Arcadian one, we all (Bob included, he was here sick-nursing me) much liked.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Herewith are a set of verses which I thought pretty enough to send to press.  Then I thought of the <hi rend="italic">Manhattan</hi>, towards whom I have guilty and compunctious feelings.  Last, I had the best thought of all—to send them to you in case you might think them suitable for illustration.  It seemed to me quite in your vein.  If so, good; if not, hand them on to <hi rend="italic">Manhattan</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Century</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">Lippincott</hi>, at your pleasure, as all three desire my work or pretend to.  But I trust the lines will not go unattended.  Some riverside will haunt you; and O! be tender to my bathing girls.  The lines are copied in my wife’s hand, as I cannot see to write otherwise than with the pen of Cormoran, Gargantua, or Nimrod.  Love to your wife.—Yours ever,</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR FATHER,—Yesterday I very powerfully stated the <hi rend="italic">Heresis Stevensoniana</hi>, or the complete body of divinity of the family theologian, to Miss Ferrier.  She was much impressed; so was I.  You are a great heresiarch; and I know no better.  Whaur the devil did ye get thon about the soap?  Is it altogether your own?  I never heard it elsewhere; and yet I suspect it must have been held at some time or other, and if you were to look up you would probably find yourself condemned by some Council.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I am glad to hear you are so well.  The hear is excellent.  The <hi rend="italic">Cornhills</hi> came; I made Miss Ferrier read us ‘Thrawn Janet,’ and was quite bowled over by my own works.  The ‘Merry Men’ I mean to make much longer, with a whole new denouement, not yet quite clear to me.  ‘The Story of a Lie,’ I must rewrite entirely also, as it is too weak and ragged, yet is worth saving for the Admiral.  Did I ever tell you that the Admiral was recognised in America?</p>
                     <p rend="justify">When they are all on their legs this will make an excellent collection.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Has Davie never read <hi rend="italic">Guy Mannering</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Rob Roy</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">The Antiquary</hi>?  All of which are worth three <hi rend="italic">Waverleys</hi>.  I think <hi rend="italic">Kenilworth</hi> better than <hi rend="italic">Waverley</hi>; <hi rend="italic">Nigel</hi>, too; and <hi rend="italic">Quentin Durward</hi> about as good.  But it shows a true piece of insight to prefer <hi rend="italic">Waverley</hi>, for it <hi rend="italic">is</hi> different; and though not quite coherent, better worked in parts than almost any other: surely more carefully.  It is undeniable that the love of the slap-dash and the shoddy grew upon Scott with success.  Perhaps it does on many of us, which may be the granite on which D.’s opinion stands.  However, I hold it, in Patrick Walker’s phrase, for an ‘old, condemned, damnable error.’  Dr. Simson was condemned by P. W. as being ‘a bagful of’ such.  One of Patrick’s amenities!</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Another ground there may be to D.’s opinion; those who avoid (or seek to avoid) Scott’s facility are apt to be continually straining and torturing their style to get in more of life.  And to many the extra significance does not redeem the strain.</p>

                     <p rend="justify">DEAR MONKHOUSE,—If you are in love with repose, here is your occasion: change with me.  I am too blind to read, hence no reading; I am too weak to walk, hence no walking; I am not allowed to speak, hence no talking; but the great simplification has yet to be named; for, if this goes on, I shall soon have nothing to eat—and hence, O Hallelujah! hence no eating.  The offer is a fair one: I have not sold myself to the devil, for I could never find him.  I am married, but so are you.  I sometimes write verses, but so do you.  Come!  <hi rend="italic">Hic quies</hi>!  As for the commandments, I have broken them so small that they are the dust of my chambers; you walk upon them, triturate and toothless; and with the Golosh of Philosophy, they shall not bite your heel.  True, the tenement is falling.  Ay, friend, but yours also.  Take a larger view; what is a year or two? dust in the balance!  ’Tis done, behold you Cosmo Stevenson, and me R. L. Monkhouse; you at Hyères, I in London; you rejoicing in the clammiest repose, me proceeding to tear your tabernacle into rags, as I have already so admirably torn my own.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">My place to which I now introduce you—it is yours—is like a London house, high and very narrow; upon the lungs I will not linger; the heart is large enough for a ballroom; the belly greedy and inefficient; the brain stocked with the most damnable explosives, like a dynamiter’s den.  The whole place is well furnished, though not in a very pure taste; Corinthian much of it; showy and not strong.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">About your place I shall try to find my way alone, an interesting exploration.  Imagine me, as I go to bed, falling over a blood-stained remorse; opening that cupboard in the cerebellum and being welcomed by the spirit of your murdered uncle.  I should probably not like your remorses; I wonder if you will like mine; I have a spirited assortment; they whistle in my ear o’ nights like a north-easter.  I trust yours don’t dine with the family; mine are better mannered; you will hear nought of them till, 2 A.M., except one, to be sure, that I have made a pet of, but he is small; I keep him in buttons, so as to avoid commentaries; you will like him much—if you like what is genuine.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Must we likewise change religions?  Mine is a good article, with a trick of stopping; cathedral bell note; ornamental dial; supported by Venus and the Graces; quite a summer-parlour piety.  Of yours, since your last, I fear there is little to be said.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">There is one article I wish to take away with me: my spirits.  They suit me.  I don’t want yours; I like my own; I have had them a long while in bottle.  It is my only reservation.—Yours (as you decide),</p>

                     <p rend="justify">I keep better, but no great shakes yet; cannot work—cannot: that is flat, not even verses: as for prose, that more active place is shut on me long since.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">My view of life is essentially the comic; and the romantically comic.  <hi rend="italic">As you Like It</hi> is to me the most bird-haunted spot in letters; <hi rend="italic">Tempest</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Twelfth Night</hi> follow.  These are what I mean by poetry and nature.  I make an effort of my mind to be quite one with Molière, except upon the stage, where his inimitable <hi rend="italic">jeux de scène</hi> beggar belief; but you will observe they are stage-plays—things <hi rend="italic">ad hoc</hi>; not great Olympian debauches of the heart and fancy; hence more perfect, and not so great.  Then I come, after great wanderings, to Carmosine and to Fantasio; to one part of La Dernière Aldini (which, by the by, we might dramatise in a week), to the notes that Meredith has found, Evan and the postillion, Evan and Rose, Harry in Germany.  And to me these things are the good; beauty, touched with sex and laughter; beauty with God’s earth for the background.  Tragedy does not seem to me to come off; and when it does, it does so by the heroic illusion; the anti-masque has been omitted; laughter, which attends on all our steps in life, and sits by the deathbed, and certainly redacts the epitaph, laughter has been lost from these great-hearted lies.  But the comedy which keeps the beauty and touches the terrors of our life (laughter and tragedy-in-a-good-humour having kissed), that is the last word of moved representation; embracing the greatest number of elements of fate and character; and telling its story, not with the one eye of pity, but with the two of pity and mirth.</p>

                     <p rend="justify">I have been out once, but now am back in bed.  I am better, and keep better, but the weather is a mere injustice.  The imitation of Edinburgh is, at times, deceptive; there is a note among the chimney pots that suggests Howe Street; though I think the shrillest spot in Christendom was not upon the Howe Street side, but in front, just under the Miss Graemes’ big chimney stack.  It had a fine alto character—a sort of bleat that used to divide the marrow in my joints—say in the wee, slack hours.  That music is now lost to us by rebuilding; another air that I remember, not regret, was the solo of the gas-burner in the little front room; a knickering, flighty, fleering, and yet spectral cackle.  I mind it above all on winter afternoons, late, when the window was blue and spotted with rare rain-drops, and, looking out, the cold evening was seen blue all over, with the lamps of Queen’s and Frederick’s Street dotting it with yellow, and flaring east-ward in the squalls.  Heavens, how unhappy I have been in such circumstances—I, who have now positively forgotten the colour of unhappiness; who am full like a fed ox, and dull like a fresh turf, and have no more spiritual life, for good or evil, than a French bagman.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">We are at Chabassière’s, for of course it was nonsense to go up the hill when we could not walk.</p>

                     <p rend="justify">I am very dim, dumb, dowie, and damnable.  I hate to be silenced; and if to talk by signs is my forte (as I contend), to understand them cannot be my wife’s.  Do not think me unhappy; I have not been so for years; but I am blurred, inhabit the debatable frontier of sleep, and have but dim designs upon activity.  All is at a standstill; books closed, paper put aside, the voice, the eternal voice of R. L. S., well silenced.  Hence this plaint reaches you with no very great meaning, no very great purpose, and written part in slumber by a heavy, dull, somnolent, superannuated son of a bedpost.</p>

                     <p rend="justify">I find in the blotting book the enclosed, which I wrote to you the eve of my blood.  Is it not strange?  That night, when I naturally thought I was coopered, the thought of it was much in my mind; I thought it had gone; and I thought what a strange prophecy I had made in jest, and how it was indeed like to be the end of many letters.  But I have written a good few since, and the spell is broken.  I am just as pleased, for I earnestly desire to live.  This pleasant middle age into whose port we are steering is quite to my fancy.  I would cast anchor here, and go ashore for twenty years, and see the manners of the place.  Youth was a great time, but somewhat fussy.  Now in middle age (bar lucre) all seems mighty placid.  It likes me; I spy a little bright café in one corner of the port, in front of which I now propose we should sit down.  There is just enough of the bustle of the harbour and no more; and the ships are close in, regarding us with stern-windows—the ships that bring deals from Norway and parrots from the Indies.  Let us sit down here for twenty years, with a packet of tobacco and a drink, and talk of art and women.  By-and-by, the whole city will sink, and the ships too, and the table, and we also; but we shall have sat for twenty years and had a fine talk; and by that time, who knows? exhausted the subject.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I send you a book which (or I am mistook) will please you; it pleased me.  But I do desire a book of adventure—a romance—and no man will get or write me one.  Dumas I have read and re-read too often; Scott, too, and I am short.  I want to hear swords clash.  I want a book to begin in a good way; a book, I guess, like <hi rend="italic">Treasure Island</hi>, alas! which I have never read, and cannot though I live to ninety.  I would God that some one else had written it!  By all that I can learn, it is the very book for my complaint.  I like the way I hear it opens; and they tell me John Silver is good fun.  And to me it is, and must ever be, a dream unrealised, a book unwritten.  O my sighings after romance, or even Skeltery, and O! the weary age which will produce me neither!</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR CAMPBELL,—The books came duly to hand.  My wife has occupied the translation <ref target="#1730040348670317495_622-h-3.htm.xhtml#footnote330">[330]</ref> ever since, nor have I yet been able to dislodge her.  As for the primer, I have read it with a very strange result: that I find no fault.  If you knew how, dogmatic and pugnacious, I stand warden on the literary art, you would the more appreciate your success and my—well, I will own it—disappointment.  For I love to put people right (or wrong) about the arts.  But what you say of Tragedy and of Sophocles very amply satisfies me; it is well felt and well said; a little less technically than it is my weakness to desire to see it put, but clear and adequate.  You are very right to express your admiration for the resource displayed in Œdipus King; it is a miracle.  Would it not have been well to mention Voltaire’s interesting onslaught, a thing which gives the best lesson of the difference of neighbour arts?—since all his criticisms, which had been fatal to a narrative, do not amount among them to exhibit one flaw in this masterpiece of drama.  For the drama, it is perfect; though such a fable in a romance might make the reader crack his sides, so imperfect, so ethereally slight is the verisimilitude required of these conventional, rigid, and egg-dancing arts.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I was sorry to see no more of you; but shall conclude by hoping for better luck next time.  My wife begs to be remembered to both of you.—Yours sincerely,</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR LOW,—Now, look here, the above is my address for three months, I hope; continue, on your part, if you please, to write to Edinburgh, which is safe; but if Mrs. Low thinks of coming to England, she might take a run down from London (four hours from Waterloo, main line) and stay a day or two with us among the pines.  If not, I hope it will be only a pleasure deferred till you can join her.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">My Children’s Verses will be published here in a volume called <hi rend="italic">A Child’s </hi>
                        <hi rend="italic">Garden</hi>.  The sheets are in hand; I will see if I cannot send you the lot, so that you might have a bit of a start.  In that case I would do nothing to publish in the States, and you might try an illustrated edition there; which, if the book went fairly over here, might, when ready, be imported.  But of this more fully ere long.  You will see some verses of mine in the last <hi rend="italic">Magazine of Art</hi>, with pictures by a young lady; rather pretty, I think.  If we find a market for <hi rend="italic">Phasellulus loquitur</hi>, we can try another.  I hope it isn’t necessary to put the verse into that rustic printing.  I am Philistine enough to prefer clean printer’s type; indeed, I can form no idea of the verses thus transcribed by the incult and tottering hand of the draughtsman, nor gather any impression beyond one of weariness to the eyes.  Yet the other day, in the <hi rend="italic">Century</hi>, I saw it imputed as a crime to Vedder that he had not thus travestied Omar Khayyàm.  We live in a rum age of music without airs, stories without incident, pictures without beauty, American wood engravings that should have been etchings, and dry-point etchings that ought to have been mezzo-tints.  I think of giving ’em literature without words; and I believe if you were to try invisible illustration, it would enjoy a considerable vogue.  So long as an artist is on his head, is painting with a flute, or writes with an etcher’s needle, or conducts the orchestra with a meat-axe, all is well; and plaudits shower along with roses.  But any plain man who tries to follow the obtrusive canons of his art, is but a commonplace figure.  To hell with him is the motto, or at least not that; for he will have his reward, but he will never be thought a person of parts.</p>

                     <p rend="justify">I wish I could hear a brighter account of yourself; but I am inclined to acquit the <hi rend="italic">Admiral</hi> of having a share in the responsibility.  My very heavy cold is, I hope, drawing off; and the change to this charming house in the forest will, I hope, complete my re-establishment.—With love to all, believe me, your ever affectionate,</p>

                     <p rend="justify">DEAR DOBSON,—Set down my delay to your own fault; I wished to acknowledge such a gift from you in some of my inapt and slovenly rhymes; but you should have sent me your pen and not your desk.  The verses stand up to the axles in a miry cross-road, whence the coursers of the sun shall never draw them; hence I am constrained to this uncourtliness, that I must appear before one of the kings of that country of rhyme without my singing robes.  For less than this, if we may trust the book of Esther, favourites have tasted death; but I conceive the kingdom of the Muses mildlier mannered; and in particular that county which you administer and which I seem to see as a half-suburban land; a land of holly-hocks and country houses; a land where at night, in thorny and sequestered bypaths, you will meet masqueraders going to a ball in their sedans, and the rector steering homeward by the light of his lantern; a land of the windmill, and the west wind, and the flowering hawthorn with a little scented letter in the hollow of its trunk, and the kites flying over all in the season of kites, and the far away blue spires of a cathedral city.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Will you forgive me, then, for my delay and accept my thanks not only for your present, but for the letter which followed it, and which perhaps I more particularly value, and believe me to be, with much admiration, yours very truly,</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR HENRY JAMES,—This is a very brave hearing from more points than one.  The first point is that there is a hope of a sequel.  For this I laboured.  Seriously, from the dearth of information and thoughtful interest in the art of literature, those who try to practise it with any deliberate purpose run the risk of finding no fit audience.  People suppose it is ‘the stuff’ that interests them; they think, for instance, that the prodigious fine thoughts and sentiments in Shakespeare impress by their own weight, not understanding that the unpolished diamond is but a stone.  They think that striking situations, or good dialogue, are got by studying life; they will not rise to understand that they are prepared by deliberate artifice and set off by painful suppressions.  Now, I want the whole thing well ventilated, for my own education and the public’s; and I beg you to look as quick as you can, to follow me up with every circumstance of defeat where we differ, and (to prevent the flouting of the laity) to emphasise the points where we agree.  I trust your paper will show me the way to a rejoinder; and that rejoinder I shall hope to make with so much art as to woo or drive you from your threatened silence.  I would not ask better than to pass my life in beating out this quarter of corn with such a seconder as yourself.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Point the second—I am rejoiced indeed to hear you speak so kindly of my work; rejoiced and surprised.  I seem to myself a very rude, left-handed countryman; not fit to be read, far less complimented, by a man so accomplished, so adroit, so craftsmanlike as you.  You will happily never have cause to understand the despair with which a writer like myself considers (say) the park scene in Lady Barberina.  Every touch surprises me by its intangible precision; and the effect when done, as light as syllabub, as distinct as a picture, fills me with envy.  Each man among us prefers his own aim, and I prefer mine; but when we come to speak of performance, I recognise myself, compared with you, to be a lout and slouch of the first water.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Where we differ, both as to the design of stories and the delineation of character, I begin to lament.  Of course, I am not so dull as to ask you to desert your walk; but could you not, in one novel, to oblige a sincere admirer, and to enrich his shelves with a beloved volume, could you not, and might you not, cast your characters in a mould a little more abstract and academic (dear Mrs. Pennyman had already, among your other work, a taste of what I mean), and pitch the incidents, I do not say in any stronger, but in a slightly more emphatic key—as it were an episode from one of the old (so-called) novels of adventure?  I fear you will not; and I suppose I must sighingly admit you to be right.  And yet, when I see, as it were, a book of Tom Jones handled with your exquisite precision and shot through with those side-lights of reflection in which you excel, I relinquish the dear vision with regret.  Think upon it.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">As you know, I belong to that besotted class of man, the invalid: this puts me to a stand in the way of visits.  But it is possible that some day you may feel that a day near the sea and among pinewoods would be a pleasant change from town.  If so, please let us know; and my wife and I will be delighted to put you up, and give you what we can to eat and drink (I have a fair bottle of claret).—On the back of which, believe me, yours sincerely,</p>

                     <p rend="justify">
                        <hi rend="italic">P.S.</hi>—I reopen this to say that I have re-read my paper, and cannot think I have at all succeeded in being either veracious or polite.  I knew, of course, that I took your paper merely as a pin to hang my own remarks upon; but, alas! what a thing is any paper!  What fine remarks can you not hang on mine!  How I have sinned against proportion, and with every effort to the contrary, against the merest rudiments of courtesy to you!  You are indeed a very acute reader to have divined the real attitude of my mind; and I can only conclude, not without closed eyes and shrinking shoulders, in the well-worn words</p>

G., and send you a copy, which please keep or return.  As for not giving a reduction, what are we?  Are we artists or city men?  Why do we sneer at stock-brokers?  O nary; I will not take the £40.  I took that as a fair price for my best work; I was not able to produce my best; and I will be damned if I steal with my eyes open.  <hi rend="italic">Sufficit</hi>.  This is my lookout.  As for the paper being rich, certainly it is; but I am honourable.  It is no more above me in money than the poor slaveys and cads from whom I look for honesty are below me.  Am I Pepys, that because I can find the countenance of ‘some of our ablest merchants,’ that because—and—pour forth languid twaddle and get paid for it, I, too, should ‘cheerfully continue to steal’?  I am not Pepys.  I do not live much to God and honour; but I will not wilfully turn my back on both.  I am, like all the rest of us, falling ever lower from the bright ideas I began with, falling into greed, into idleness, into middle-aged and slippered fireside cowardice; but is it you, my bold blade, that I hear crying this sordid and rank twaddle in my ear?  Preaching the dankest Grundyism and upholding the rank customs of our trade—you, who are so cruel hard upon the customs of the publishers?  O man, look at the Beam in our own Eyes; and whatever else you do, do not plead Satan’s cause, or plead it for all; either embrace the bad, or respect the good when you see a poor devil trying for it.  If this is the honesty of authors—to take what you can get and console yourself because publishers are rich—take my name from the rolls of that association.  ’Tis a caucus of weaker thieves, jealous of the stronger.—Ever yours,</p>

C. had risen to the paper on James?  At last!  O but I was pleased; he’s (like Johnnie) been lang, lang o’ comin’, but here he is.  He will not object to my future manœuvres in the same field, as he has to my former.  All the family are here; my father better than I have seen him these two years; my mother the same as ever.  I do trust you are better, and I am yours ever,</p>

S. C. Scheme of last Session of P.’, likes me the best.  I think it a very good paper; and I am vain enough to think I have materially helped to polish the diamond.  I ended by feeling quite proud of the paper, as if it had been mine; the next time you have as good a one, I will overhaul it for the wages of feeling as clever as I did when I had managed to understand and helped to set it clear.  I wonder if I anywhere misapprehended you?  I rather think not at the last; at the first shot I know I missed a point or two.  Some of what may appear to you to be wanton changes, a little study will show to be necessary.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Yes, Carlyle was ashamed of himself as few men have been; and let all carpers look at what he did.  He prepared all these papers for publication with his own hand; all his wife’s complaints, all the evidence of his own misconduct: who else would have done so much?  Is repentance, which God accepts, to have no avail with men? nor even with the dead?  I have heard too much against the thrawn, discomfortable dog: dead he is, and we may be glad of it; but he was a better man than most of us, no less patently than he was a worse.  To fill the world with whining is against all my views: I do not like impiety.  But—but—there are two sides to all things, and the old scalded baby had his noble side.—Ever affectionate son,</p>

                     <p rend="justify">About your book, I have always said: go on.  The drawing of character is a different thing from publishing the details of a private career.  No one objects to the first, or should object, if his name be not put upon it; at the other, I draw the line.  In a preface, if you chose, you might distinguish; it is, besides, a thing for which you are eminently well equipped, and which you would do with taste and incision.  I long to see the book.  People like themselves (to explain a little more); no one likes his life, which is a misbegotten issue, and a tale of failure.  To see these failures either touched upon, or <hi rend="italic">coasted</hi>, to get the idea of a spying eye and blabbing tongue about the house, is to lose all privacy in life.  To see that thing, which we do love, our character, set forth, is ever gratifying.  See how my <hi rend="italic">Talk and Talkers</hi> went; every one liked his own portrait, and shrieked about other people’s; so it will be with yours.  If you are the least true to the essential, the sitter will be pleased; very likely not his friends, and that from <hi rend="italic">various motives</hi>.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">Bournemouth</hi>, <hi rend="italic">February</hi> 1885.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR SYMONDS,—Yes, we have both been very neglectful.  I had horrid luck, catching two thundering influenzas in August and November.  I recovered from the last with difficulty, but have come through this blustering winter with some general success; in the house, up and down.  My wife, however, has been painfully upset by my health.  Last year, of course, was cruelly trying to her nerves; Nice and Hyères are bad experiences; and though she is not ill, the doctor tells me that prolonged anxiety may do her a real mischief.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I feel a little old and fagged, and chary of speech, and not very sure of spirit in my work; but considering what a year I have passed, and how I have twice sat on Charon’s pierhead, I am surprising.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">My father has presented us with a very pretty home in this place, into which we hope to move by May.  My <hi rend="italic">Child’s Verses</hi> come out next week.  <hi rend="italic">Otto</hi> begins to appear in April; <hi rend="italic">More New Arabian Nights</hi> as soon as possible.  Moreover, I am neck deep in Wellington; also a story on the stocks, <hi rend="italic">Great North Road</hi>.  O, I am busy! Lloyd is at college in Edinburgh.  That is, I think, all that can be said by way of news.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Have you read <hi rend="italic">Huckleberry Finn</hi>?  It contains many excellent things; above all, the whole story of a healthy boy’s dealings with his conscience, incredibly well done.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">My own conscience is badly seared; a want of piety; yet I pray for it, tacitly, every day; believing it, after courage, the only gift worth having; and its want, in a man of any claims to honour, quite unpardonable.  The tone of your letter seemed to me very sound.  In these dark days of public dishonour, I do not know that one can do better than carry our private trials piously.  What a picture is this of a nation!  No man that I can see, on any side or party, seems to have the least sense of our ineffable shame: the desertion of the garrisons.  I tell my little parable that Germany took England, and then there was an Indian Mutiny, and Bismarck said: ‘Quite right: let Delhi and Calcutta and Bombay fall; and let the women and children be treated Sepoy fashion,’ and people say, ‘O, but that is very different!’  And then I wish I were dead.  Millais (I hear) was painting Gladstone when the news came of Gordon’s death; Millais was much affected, and Gladstone said, ‘Why?  <hi rend="italic">It is the man’s own temerity</hi>!’  Voilà le Bourgeois! le voilà nu!  But why should I blame Gladstone, when I too am a Bourgeois? when I have held my peace?  Why did I hold my peace?  Because I am a sceptic: <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> a Bourgeois.  We believe in nothing, Symonds; you don’t, and I don’t; and these are two reasons, out of a handful of millions, why England stands before the world dripping with blood and daubed with dishonour.  I will first try to take the beam out of my own eye, trusting that even private effort somehow betters and braces the general atmosphere.  See, for example, if England has shown (I put it hypothetically) one spark of manly sensibility, they have been shamed into it by the spectacle of Gordon.  Police-Officer Cole is the only man that I see to admire.  I dedicate my <hi rend="italic">New Arabs</hi> to him and Cox, in default of other great public characters.—Yours ever most affectionately,</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR GOSSE,—I was indeed much exercised how I could be worked into Gray; and lo! when I saw it, the passage seemed to have been written with a single eye to elucidate the—worst?—well, not a very good poem of Gray’s.  Your little life is excellent, clean, neat, efficient.  I have read many of your notes, too, with pleasure.  Your connection with Gray was a happy circumstance; it was a suitable conjunction.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I did not answer your letter from the States, for what was I to say?  I liked getting it and reading it; I was rather flattered that you wrote it to me; and then I’ll tell you what I did—I put it in the fire.  Why?  Well, just because it was very natural and expansive; and thinks I to myself, if I die one of these fine nights, this is just the letter that Gosse would not wish to go into the hands of third parties.  Was I well inspired?  And I did not answer it because you were in your high places, sailing with supreme dominion, and seeing life in a particular glory; and I was peddling in a corner, confined to the house, overwhelmed with necessary work, which I was not always doing well, and, in the very mild form in which the disease approaches me, touched with a sort of bustling cynicism.  Why throw cold water?  How ape your agreeable frame of mind?  In short, I held my tongue.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I have now published on 101 small pages <hi rend="italic">The Complete Proof of Mr. R. L. Stevenson’s Incapacity to Write Verse</hi>, in a series of graduated examples with table of contents.  I think I shall issue a companion volume of exercises: ‘Analyse this poem.  Collect and comminate the ugly words.  Distinguish and condemn the <hi rend="italic">chevilles</hi>.  State Mr. Stevenson’s faults of taste in regard to the measure.  What reasons can you gather from this example for your belief that Mr. S. is unable to write any other measure?’</p>
                     <p rend="justify">They look ghastly in the cold light of print; but there is something nice in the little ragged regiment for all; the blackguards seem to me to smile, to have a kind of childish treble note that sounds in my ears freshly; not song, if you will, but a child’s voice.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I was glad you enjoyed your visit to the States.  Most Englishmen go there with a confirmed design of patronage, as they go to France for that matter; and patronage will not pay.  Besides, in this year of—grace, said I?—of disgrace, who should creep so low as an Englishman?  ‘It is not to be thought of that the flood’—ah, Wordsworth, you would change your note were you alive to-day!</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I am now a beastly householder, but have not yet entered on my domain.  When I do, the social revolution will probably cast me back upon my dung heap.  There is a person called Hyndman whose eye is on me; his step is beHynd me as I go.  I shall call my house Skerryvore when I get it: SKERRYVORE: <hi rend="italic">c’est bon pour la poéshie</hi>.  I will conclude with my favourite sentiment: ‘The world is too much with me.’</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR LOW,—Your success has been immense.  I wish your letter had come two days ago: <hi rend="italic">Otto</hi>, alas! has been disposed of a good while ago; but it was only day before yesterday that I settled the new volume of Arabs.  However, for the future, you and the sons of the deified Scribner are the men for me.  Really they have behaved most handsomely.  I cannot lay my hand on the papers, or I would tell you exactly how it compares with my English bargain; but it compares well.  Ah, if we had that copyright, I do believe it would go far to make me solvent, ill-health and all.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I wrote you a letter to the Rembrandt, in which I stated my views about the dedication in a very brief form.  It will give me sincere pleasure, and will make the second dedication I have received, the other being from John Addington Symonds.  It is a compliment I value much; I don’t know any that I should prefer.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I am glad to hear you have windows to do; that is a fine business, I think; but, alas! the glass is so bad nowadays; realism invading even that, as well as the huge inferiority of our technical resource corrupting every tint.  Still, anything that keeps a man to decoration is, in this age, good for the artist’s spirit.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">By the way, have you seen James and me on the novel?  James, I think in the August or September—R. L. S. in the December <hi rend="italic">Longman</hi>.  I own I think the <hi rend="italic">école bête</hi>, of which I am the champion, has the whip hand of the argument; but as James is to make a rejoinder, I must not boast.  Anyway the controversy is amusing to see.  I was terribly tied down to space, which has made the end congested and dull.  I shall see if I can afford to send you the April <hi rend="italic">Contemporary</hi>—but I dare say you see it anyway—as it will contain a paper of mine on style, a sort of continuation of old arguments on art in which you have wagged a most effective tongue.  It is a sort of start upon my Treatise on the Art of Literature: a small, arid book that shall some day appear.</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR HAMERTON,—Various things have been reminding me of my misconduct: First, Swan’s application for your address; second, a sight of the sheets of your <hi rend="italic">Landscape</hi> book; and last, your note to Swan, which he was so kind as to forward.  I trust you will never suppose me to be guilty of anything more serious than an idleness, partially excusable.  My ill-health makes my rate of life heavier than I can well meet, and yet stops me from earning more.  My conscience, sometimes perhaps too easily stifled, but still (for my time of life and the public manners of the age) fairly well alive, forces me to perpetual and almost endless transcriptions.  On the back of all this, my correspondence hangs like a thundercloud; and just when I think I am getting through my troubles, crack, down goes my health, I have a long, costly sickness, and begin the world again.  It is fortunate for me I have a father, or I should long ago have died; but the opportunity of the aid makes the necessity none the more welcome.  My father has presented me with a beautiful house here—or so I believe, for I have not yet seen it, being a cage bird but for nocturnal sorties in the garden.  I hope we shall soon move into it, and I tell myself that some day perhaps we may have the pleasure of seeing you as our guest.  I trust at least that you will take me as I am, a thoroughly bad correspondent, and a man, a hater, indeed, of rudeness in others, but too often rude in all unconsciousness himself; and that you will never cease to believe the sincere sympathy and admiration that I feel for you and for your work.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">About the <hi rend="italic">Landscape</hi>, which I had a glimpse of while a friend of mine was preparing a review, I was greatly interested, and could write and wrangle for a year on every page; one passage particularly delighted me, the part about Ulysses—jolly.  Then, you know, that is just what I fear I have come to think landscape ought to be in literature; so there we should be at odds.  Or perhaps not so much as I suppose, as Montaigne says it is a pot with two handles, and I own I am wedded to the technical handle, which (I likewise own and freely) you do well to keep for a mistress.  I should much like to talk with you about some other points; it is only in talk that one gets to understand.  Your delightful Wordsworth trap I have tried on two hardened Wordsworthians, not that I am not one myself.  By covering up the context, and asking them to guess what the passage was, both (and both are very clever people, one a writer, one a painter) pronounced it a guide-book.  ‘Do you think it an unusually good guide-book?’ I asked, and both said, ‘No, not at all!’  Their grimace was a picture when I showed the original.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I trust your health and that of Mrs. Hamerton keep better; your last account was a poor one.  I was unable to make out the visit I had hoped, as (I do not know if you heard of it) I had a very violent and dangerous hæmorrhage last spring.  I am almost glad to have seen death so close with all my wits about me, and not in the customary lassitude and disenchantment of disease.  Even thus clearly beheld I find him not so terrible as we suppose.  But, indeed, with the passing of years, the decay of strength, the loss of all my old active and pleasant habits, there grows more and more upon me that belief in the kindness of this scheme of things, and the goodness of our veiled God, which is an excellent and pacifying compensation.  I trust, if your health continues to trouble you, you may find some of the same belief.  But perhaps my fine discovery is a piece of art, and belongs to a character cowardly, intolerant of certain feelings, and apt to self-deception.  I don’t think so, however; and when I feel what a weak and fallible vessel I was thrust into this hurly-burly, and with what marvellous kindness the wind has been tempered to my frailties, I think I should be a strange kind of ass to feel anything but gratitude.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I do not know why I should inflict this talk upon you; but when I summon the rebellous pen, he must go his own way; I am no Michael Scott, to rule the fiend of correspondence.  Most days he will none of me; and when he comes, it is to rape me where he will.—Yours very sincerely,</p>

                     <p rend="justify">DEAR MR. ARCHER,—Yes, I have heard of you and read some of your work; but I am bound in particular to thank you for the notice of my verses.  ‘There,’ I said, throwing it over to the friend who was staying with me, ‘it’s worth writing a book to draw an article like that.’  Had you been as hard upon me as you were amiable, I try to tell myself I should have been no blinder to the merits of your notice.  For I saw there, to admire and to be very grateful for, a most sober, agile pen; an enviable touch; the marks of a reader, such as one imagines for one’s self in dreams, thoughtful, critical, and kind; and to put the top on this memorial column, a greater readiness to describe the author criticised than to display the talents of his censor.</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR MRS. JENKIN,—You know how much and for how long I have loved, respected, and admired him; I am only able to feel a little with you.  But I know how he would have wished us to feel.  I never knew a better man, nor one to me more lovable; we shall all feel the loss more greatly as time goes on.  It scarce seems life to me; what must it be to you?  Yet one of the last things that he said to me was, that from all these sad bereavements of yours he had learned only more than ever to feel the goodness and what we, in our feebleness, call the support of God; he had been ripening so much—to other eyes than ours, we must suppose he was ripe, and try to feel it.  I feel it is better not to say much more.  It will be to me a great pride to write a notice of him: the last I can now do.  What more in any way I can do for you, please to think and let me know.  For his sake and for your own, I would not be a useless friend: I know, you know me a most warm one; please command me or my wife, in any way.  Do not trouble to write to me; Austin, I have no doubt, will do so, if you are, as I fear you will be, unfit.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">My heart is sore for you.  At least you know what you have been to him; how he cherished and admired you; how he was never so pleased as when he spoke of you; with what a boy’s love, up to the last, he loved you.  This surely is a consolation.  Yours is the cruel part—to survive; you must try and not grudge to him his better fortune, to go first.  It is the sad part of such relations that one must remain and suffer; I cannot see my poor Jenkin without you.  Nor you indeed without him; but you may try to rejoice that he is spared that extremity.  Perhaps I (as I was so much his confidant) know even better than you can do what your loss would have been to him; he never spoke of you but his face changed; it was—you were—his religion.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I write by this post to Austin and to the <hi rend="italic">Academy</hi>.—Yours most sincerely,</p>

                     <p rend="justify">I had a note from Henley, very brief and very sad.  We none of us yet feel the loss; but we know what he would have said and wished.</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR LOW,—I trust you are not annoyed with me beyond forgiveness; for indeed my silence has been devilish prolonged.  I can only tell you that I have been nearly six months (more than six) in a strange condition of collapse, when it was impossible to do any work, and difficult (more difficult than you would suppose) to write the merest note.  I am now better, but not yet my own man in the way of brains, and in health only so-so.  I suppose I shall learn (I begin to think I am learning) to fight this vast, vague feather-bed of an obsession that now overlies and smothers me; but in the beginnings of these conflicts, the inexperienced wrestler is always worsted, and I own I have been quite extinct.  I wish you to know, though it can be no excuse, that you are not the only one of my friends by many whom I have thus neglected; and even now, having come so very late into the possession of myself, with a substantial capital of debts, and my work still moving with a desperate slowness—as a child might fill a sandbag with its little handfuls—and my future deeply pledged, there is almost a touch of virtue in my borrowing these hours to write to you.  Why I said ‘hours’ I know not; it would look blue for both of us if I made good the word.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I was writing your address the other day, ordering a copy of my next, <hi rend="italic">Prince Otto</hi>, to go your way.  I hope you have not seen it in parts; it was not meant to be so read; and only my poverty (dishonourably) consented to the serial evolution.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I will send you with this a copy of the English edition of the <hi rend="italic">Child’s Garden</hi>.  I have heard there is some vile rule of the post-office in the States against inscriptions; so I send herewith a piece of doggerel which Mr. Bunner may, if he thinks fit, copy off the fly leaf.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Sargent was down again and painted a portrait of me walking about in my own dining-room, in my own velveteen jacket, and twisting as I go my own moustache; at one corner a glimpse of my wife, in an Indian dress, and seated in a chair that was once my grandfather’s; but since some months goes by the name of Henry James’s, for it was there the novelist loved to sit—adds a touch of poesy and comicality.  It is, I think, excellent, but is too eccentric to be exhibited.  I am at one extreme corner; my wife, in this wild dress, and looking like a ghost, is at the extreme other end; between us an open door exhibits my palatial entrance hall and a part of my respected staircase.  All this is touched in lovely, with that witty touch of Sargent’s; but, of course, it looks dam queer as a whole.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Pray let me hear from you, and give me good news of yourself and your wife, to whom please remember me.—Yours most sincerely, my dear Low,</p>

                     <p rend="justify">DEAR LAD,—If there was any more praise in what you wrote, I think [the editor] has done us both a service; some of it stops my throat.  What, it would not have been the same if Dumas or Musset had done it, would it not?  Well, no, I do not think it would, do you know, now; I am really of opinion it would not; and a dam good job too.  Why, think what Musset would have made of Otto!  Think how gallantly Dumas would have carried his crowd through!  And whatever you do, don’t quarrel with —.  It gives me much pleasure to see your work there; I think you do yourself great justice in that field; and I would let no annoyance, petty or justifiable, debar me from such a market.  I think you do good there.  Whether (considering our intimate relations) you would not do better to refrain from reviewing me, I will leave to yourself: were it all on my side, you could foresee my answer; but there is your side also, where you must be the judge.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">As for the <hi rend="italic">Saturday</hi>.  Otto is no ‘fool,’ the reader is left in no doubt as to whether or not Seraphina was a Messalina (though much it would matter, if you come to that); and therefore on both these points the reviewer has been unjust.  Secondly, the romance lies precisely in the freeing of two spirits from these court intrigues; and here I think the reviewer showed himself dull.  Lastly, if Otto’s speech is offensive to him, he is one of the large class of unmanly and ungenerous dogs who arrogate and defile the name of manly.  As for the passages quoted, I do confess that some of them reek Gongorically; they are excessive, but they are not inelegant after all.  However, had he attacked me only there, he would have scored.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Your criticism on Gondremark is, I fancy, right.  I thought all your criticisms were indeed; only your praise—chokes me.—Yours ever,</p>

                     <p rend="justify">DEAR MR. ARCHER,—I have read your paper with my customary admiration; it is very witty, very adroit; it contains a great deal that is excellently true (particularly the parts about my stories and the description of me as an artist in life); but you will not be surprised if I do not think it altogether just.  It seems to me, in particular, that you have wilfully read all my works in terms of my earliest; my aim, even in style, has quite changed in the last six or seven years; and this I should have thought you would have noticed.  Again, your first remark upon the affectation of the italic names; a practice only followed in my two affected little books of travel, where a typographical <hi rend="italic">minauderie</hi> of the sort appeared to me in character; and what you say of it, then, is quite just.  But why should you forget yourself and use these same italics as an index to my theology some pages further on?  This is lightness of touch indeed; may I say, it is almost sharpness of practice?</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Excuse these remarks.  I have been on the whole much interested, and sometimes amused.  Are you aware that the praiser of this ‘brave gymnasium’ has not seen a canoe nor taken a long walk since ’79? that he is rarely out of the house nowadays, and carries his arm in a sling?  Can you imagine that he is a backslidden communist, and is sure he will go to hell (if there be such an excellent institution) for the luxury in which he lives?  And can you believe that, though it is gaily expressed, the thought is hag and skeleton in every moment of vacuity or depression?  Can you conceive how profoundly I am irritated by the opposite affectation to my own, when I see strong men and rich men bleating about their sorrows and the burthen of life, in a world full of ‘cancerous paupers,’ and poor sick children, and the fatally bereaved, ay, and down even to such happy creatures as myself, who has yet been obliged to strip himself, one after another, of all the pleasures that he had chosen except smoking (and the days of that I know in my heart ought to be over), I forgot eating, which I still enjoy, and who sees the circle of impotence closing very slowly but quite steadily around him?  In my view, one dank, dispirited word is harmful, a crime of <hi rend="italic">lèse-humanité</hi>, a piece of acquired evil; every gay, every bright word or picture, like every pleasant air of music, is a piece of pleasure set afloat; the reader catches it, and, if he be healthy, goes on his way rejoicing; and it is the business of art so to send him, as often as possible.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">For what you say, so kindly, so prettily, so precisely, of my style, I must in particular thank you; though even here, I am vexed you should not have remarked on my attempted change of manner: seemingly this attempt is still quite unsuccessful!  Well, we shall fight it out on this line if it takes all summer.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">And now for my last word: Mrs. Stevenson is very anxious that you should see me, and that she should see you, in the flesh.  If you at all share in these views, I am a fixture.  Write or telegraph (giving us time, however, to telegraph in reply, lest the day be impossible), and come down here to a bed and a dinner.  What do you say, my dear critic?  I shall be truly pleased to see you; and to explain at greater length what I meant by saying narrative was the most characteristic mood of literature, on which point I have great hopes I shall persuade you.—Yours truly,</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">P.S.</hi>—My opinion about Thoreau, and the passage in <hi rend="italic">The Week</hi>, is perhaps a fad, but it is sincere and stable.  I am still of the same mind five years later; did you observe that I had said ‘modern’ authors? and will you observe again that this passage touches the very joint of our division?  It is one that appeals to me, deals with that part of life that I think the most important, and you, if I gather rightly, so much less so?  You believe in the extreme moment of the facts that humanity has acquired and is acquiring; I think them of moment, but still or much less than those inherent or inherited brute principles and laws that sit upon us (in the character of conscience) as heavy as a shirt of mail, and that (in the character of the affections and the airy spirit of pleasure) make all the light of our lives.  The house is, indeed, a great thing, and should be rearranged on sanitary principles; but my heart and all my interest are with the dweller, that ancient of days and day-old infant man.</p>

                     <p rend="justify">An excellent touch is p. 584.  ‘By instinct or design he eschews what demands constructive patience.’  I believe it is both; my theory is that literature must always be most at home in treating movement and change; hence I look for them.</p>

                     <p rend="justify">MY DEAR HENRY JAMES,—At last, my wife being at a concert, and a story being done, I am at some liberty to write and give you of my views.  And first, many thanks for the works that came to my sickbed.  And second, and more important, as to the <hi rend="italic">Princess</hi>. <ref target="#1730040348670317495_622-h-3.htm.xhtml#footnote368">[368]</ref>  Well, I think you are going to do it this time; I cannot, of course, foresee, but these two first numbers seem to me picturesque and sound and full of lineament, and very much a new departure.  As for your young lady, she is all there; yes, sir, you can do low life, I believe.  The prison was excellent; it was of that nature of touch that I sometimes achingly miss from your former work; with some of the grime, that is, and some of the emphasis of skeleton there is in nature.  I pray you to take grime in a good sense; it need not be ignoble: dirt may have dignity; in nature it usually has; and your prison was imposing.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">And now to the main point: why do we not see you?  Do not fail us.  Make an alarming sacrifice, and let us see ‘Henry James’s chair’ properly occupied.  I never sit in it myself (though it was my grandfather’s); it has been consecrated to guests by your approval, and now stands at my elbow gaping.  We have a new room, too, to introduce to you—our last baby, the drawing-room; it never cries, and has cut its teeth.  Likewise, there is a cat now.  It promises to be a monster of laziness and self-sufficiency.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Pray see, in the November <hi rend="italic">Time</hi> (a dread name for a magazine of light reading), a very clever fellow, W. Archer, stating his views of me; the rosy-gilled ‘athletico-æsthete’; and warning me, in a fatherly manner, that a rheumatic fever would try my philosophy (as indeed it would), and that my gospel would not do for ‘those who are shut out from the exercise of any manly virtue save renunciation.’  To those who know that rickety and cloistered spectre, the real R. L. S., the paper, besides being clever in itself, presents rare elements of sport.  The critical parts are in particular very bright and neat, and often excellently true.  Get it by all manner of means.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I hear on all sides I am to be attacked as an immoral writer; this is painful.  Have I at last got, like you, to the pitch of being attacked?  ’Tis the consecration I lack—and could do without.  Not that Archer’s paper is an attack, or what either he or I, I believe, would call one; ’tis the attacks on my morality (which I had thought a gem of the first water) I referred to.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Now, my dear James, come—come—come.  The spirit (that is me) says, Come; and the bride (and that is my wife) says, Come; and the best thing you can do for us and yourself and your work is to get up and do so right away,—Yours affectionately,</p>

                     <p rend="justify">DEAR MR. ARCHER.—It is possible my father may be soon down with me; he is an old man and in bad health and spirits; and I could neither leave him alone, nor could we talk freely before him.  If he should be here when you offer your visit, you will understand if I have to say no, and put you off.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I quite understand your not caring to refer to things of private knowledge.  What still puzzles me is how you (‘in the witness box’—ha!  I like the phrase) should have made your argument actually hinge on a contention which the facts answered.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">I am pleased to hear of the correctness of my guess.  It is then as I supposed; you are of the school of the generous and not the sullen pessimists; and I can feel with you.  I used myself to rage when I saw sick folk going by in their Bath-chairs; since I have been sick myself (and always when I was sick myself), I found life, even in its rough places, to have a property of easiness.  That which we suffer ourselves has no longer the same air of monstrous injustice and wanton cruelty that suffering wears when we see it in the case of others.  So we begin gradually to see that things are not black, but have their strange compensations; and when they draw towards their worst, the idea of death is like a bed to lie on.  I should bear false witness if I did not declare life happy.  And your wonderful statement that happiness tends to die out and misery to continue, which was what put me on the track of your frame of mind, is diagnostic of the happy man raging over the misery of others; it could never be written by the man who had tried what unhappiness was like.  And at any rate, it was a slip of the pen: the ugliest word that science has to declare is a reserved indifference to happiness and misery in the individual; it declares no leaning toward the black, no iniquity on the large scale in fate’s doings, rather a marble equality, dread not cruel, giving and taking away and reconciling.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">Why have I not written my <hi rend="italic">Timon</hi>?  Well, here is my worst quarrel with you.  You take my young books as my last word.  The tendency to try to say more has passed unperceived (my fault, that).  And you make no allowance for the slowness with which a man finds and tries to learn his tools.  I began with a neat brisk little style, and a sharp little knack of partial observation; I have tried to expand my means, but still I can only utter a part of what I wish to say, and am bound to feel; and much of it will die unspoken.  But if I had the pen of Shakespeare, I have no <hi rend="italic">Timon</hi> to give forth.  I feel kindly to the powers that be; I marvel they should use me so well; and when I think of the case of others, I wonder too, but in another vein, whether they may not, whether they must not, be like me, still with some compensation, some delight.  To have suffered, nay, to suffer, sets a keen edge on what remains of the agreeable.  This is a great truth, and has to be learned in the fire.—Yours very truly,</p>

                     <p rend="justify">DEAR MR. ARCHER,—You will see that I had already had a sight of your article and what were my thoughts.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">One thing in your letter puzzles me.  Are you, too, not in the witness-box?  And if you are, why take a wilfully false hypothesis?  If you knew I was a chronic invalid, why say that my philosophy was unsuitable to such a case?  My call for facts is not so general as yours, but an essential fact should not be put the other way about.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">The fact is, consciously or not, you doubt my honesty; you think I am making faces, and at heart disbelieve my utterances.  And this I am disposed to think must spring from your not having had enough of pain, sorrow, and trouble in your existence.  It is easy to have too much; easy also or possible to have too little; enough is required that a man may appreciate what elements of consolation and joy there are in everything but absolutely over-powering physical pain or disgrace, and how in almost all circumstances the human soul can play a fair part.  You fear life, I fancy, on the principle of the hand of little employment.  But perhaps my hypothesis is as unlike the truth as the one you chose.  Well, if it be so, if you have had trials, sickness, the approach of death, the alienation of friends, poverty at the heels, and have not felt your soul turn round upon these things and spurn them under—you must be very differently made from me, and I earnestly believe from the majority of men.  But at least you are in the right to wonder and complain.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">To ‘say all’?  Stay here.  All at once?  That would require a word from the pen of Gargantua.  We say each particular thing as it comes up, and ‘with that sort of emphasis that for the time there seems to be no other.’  Words will not otherwise serve us; no, nor even Shakespeare, who could not have put <hi rend="italic">As You Like It</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Timon</hi> into one without ruinous loss both of emphasis and substance.  Is it quite fair then to keep your face so steadily on my most light-hearted works, and then say I recognise no evil?  Yet in the paper on Burns, for instance, I show myself alive to some sorts of evil.  But then, perhaps, they are not your sorts.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">And again: ‘to say all’?  All: yes.  Everything: no.  The task were endless, the effect nil.  But my all, in such a vast field as this of life, is what interests me, what stands out, what takes on itself a presence for my imagination or makes a figure in that little tricky abbreviation which is the best that my reason can conceive.  That I must treat, or I shall be fooling with my readers.  That, and not the all of some one else.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">And here we come to the division: not only do I believe that literature should give joy, but I see a universe, I suppose, eternally different from yours; a solemn, a terrible, but a very joyous and noble universe, where suffering is not at least wantonly inflicted, though it falls with dispassionate partiality, but where it may be and generally is nobly borne; where, above all (this I believe; probably you don’t: I think he may, with cancer), <hi rend="italic">any brave man may make</hi> out a life which shall be happy for himself, and, by so being, beneficent to those about him.  And if he fails, why should I hear him weeping?  I mean if I fail, why should I weep?  Why should <hi rend="italic">you</hi> hear <hi rend="italic">me</hi>?  Then to me morals, the conscience, the affections, and the passions are, I will own frankly and sweepingly, so infinitely more important than the other parts of life, that I conceive men rather triflers who become immersed in the latter; and I will always think the man who keeps his lip stiff, and makes ‘a happy fireside clime,’ and carries a pleasant face about to friends and neighbours, infinitely greater (in the abstract) than an atrabilious Shakespeare or a backbiting Kant or Darwin.  No offence to any of these gentlemen, two of whom probably (one for certain) came up to my standard.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">And now enough said; it were hard if a poor man could not criticise another without having so much ink shed against him.  But I shall still regret you should have written on an hypothesis you knew to be untenable, and that you should thus have made your paper, for those who do not know me, essentially unfair.  The rich, fox-hunting squire speaks with one voice; the sick man of letters with another.—Yours very truly,</p>

                     <p rend="justify">But, again, there is this mountain-range between us—<hi rend="italic">that you do not believe me</hi>.  It is not flattering, but the fault is probably in my literary art.</p>

                     <p rend="justify">Yes, you are lucky to have a bag that holds you comfortably.  Mine is a strange contrivance; I don’t die, damme, and I can’t get along on both feet to save my soul; I am a chronic sickist; and my work cripples along between bed and the parlour, between the medicine bottle and the cupping glass.  Well, I like my life all the same; and should like it none the worse if I could have another talk with you, though even my talks now are measured out to me by the minute hand like poisons in a minim glass.</p>
                     <p rend="justify">A photograph will be taken of my ugly mug and sent to you for ulterior purposes: I have another thing coming out, which I did not put in the way of the Scribners, I can scarce tell how; but I was sick and penniless and rather back on the world, and mismanaged it.  I trust they will forgive me.</p>

                  <p>Updated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will be renamed.</p>
                  <p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without permission and without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™ concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.</p>

                  <head>The Full Project Gutenberg License</head>
                  <p>PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</p>
                  <p>To protect the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting the free distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work (or any other work associated in any way with the phrase “Project Gutenberg”), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project Gutenberg™ License available with this file or online at www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>
                  <p>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works</p>
                  <p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™ electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property (trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project Gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.</p>
                  <p>1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>
                  <p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual works in the collection are in the public domain in the United States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the United States and you are located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™ works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when you share it without charge with others.</p>
                  <p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States, check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any country other than the United States.</p>
                  <p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>
                  <p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>
                  <p rend="justify">This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online at <ref target="https://www.gutenberg.org/">www.gutenberg.org</ref>. If you are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws of the country where you are located before using this eBook.</p>
                  <p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™ trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>
                  <p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.</p>
                  <p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg™ License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.</p>
                  <p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project Gutenberg™ License.</p>
                  <p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary, compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website (www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>
                  <p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying, performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg™ works unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>
                  <p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works provided that:</p>
                  <p>• You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.”</p>
                  <p>• You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™ License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™ works.</p>
                  <p>• You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of receipt of the work.</p>
                  <p>• You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.</p>
                  <p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>
                  <p>1.F.</p>
                  <p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™ electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.</p>
                  <p>1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the “Right of Replacement or Refund” described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, and any other party distributing a Project Gutenberg™ electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.</p>
                  <p>1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further opportunities to fix the problem.</p>
                  <p>1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you ‘AS-IS’, WITH NO OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.</p>
                  <p>1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.</p>
                  <p>1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone providing copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg™ work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg™ work, and (c) any Defect you cause.</p>
                  <p>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™</p>
                  <p>Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.</p>
                  <p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.</p>
                  <p>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</p>
                  <p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit 501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.</p>
                  <p>The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact</p>
                  <p>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</p>
                  <p>Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.</p>
                  <p rend="justify">The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit <ref target="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</ref>.</p>
                  <p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate.</p>
                  <p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>
                  <p>Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>
                  <p>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works</p>
                  <p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</p>
                  <p>Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>
                  <p rend="justify">Most people start at our website which has the main PG search facility: <ref target="https://www.gutenberg.org/">www.gutenberg.org</ref>.</p>
                  <p>This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>

                     <p>DEAREST KATHARINE,—Here, on a very little book and accompanied with lame verses, I have put your name.  Our kindness is now getting well on in years; it must be nearly of age; and it gets more valuable to me with every time I see you.  It is not possible to express any sentiment, and it is not necessary to try, at least between us.  You know very well that I love you dearly, and that I always will.  I only wish the verses were better, but at least you like the story; and it is sent to you by the one that loves you—Jekyll, and not Hyde.</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR KINNICUM,—I am a very bad dog, but not for the first time.  Your book, which is very interesting, came duly; and I immediately got a very bad cold indeed, and have been fit for nothing whatever.  I am a bit better now, and aye on the mend; so I write to tell you, I thought of you on New Year’s Day; though, I own, it would have been more decent if I had thought in time for you to get my letter then.  Well, what can’t be cured must be endured, Mr. Lawrie; and you must be content with what I give.  If I wrote all the letters I ought to write, and at the proper time, I should be very good and very happy; but I doubt if I should do anything else.</p>
                     <p>I suppose you will be in town for the New Year; and I hope your health is pretty good.  What you want is diet; but it is as much use to tell you that as it is to tell my father.  And I quite admit a diet is a beastly thing.  I doubt, however, if it be as bad as not being allowed to speak, which I have tried fully, and do not like.  When, at the same time, I was not allowed to read, it passed a joke.  But these are troubles of the past, and on this day, at least, it is proper to suppose they won’t return.  But we are not put here to enjoy ourselves: it was not God’s purpose; and I am prepared to argue, it is not our sincere wish.  As for our deserts, the less said of them the better, for somebody might hear, and nobody cares to be laughed at.  A good man is a very noble thing to see, but not to himself; what he seems to God is, fortunately, not our business; that is the domain of faith; and whether on the first of January or the thirty-first of December, faith is a good word to end on.</p>
                     <p>My dear Cummy, many happy returns to you and my best love.—The worst correspondent in the world,</p>
                     <p>Robert Louis Stevenson.</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR PEOPLE,—Many happy returns of the day to you all; I am fairly well and in good spirits; and much and hopefully occupied with dear Jenkin’s life.  The inquiry in every detail, every letter that I read, makes me think of him more nobly.  I cannot imagine how I got his friendship; I did not deserve it.  I believe the notice will be interesting and useful.</p>
                     <p>My father’s last letter, owing to the use of a quill pen and the neglect of blotting-paper, was hopelessly illegible.  Every one tried, and every one failed to decipher an important word on which the interest of one whole clause (and the letter consisted of two) depended.</p>
                     <p>I find I can make little more of this; but I’ll spare the blots.—Dear people, ever your loving son,</p>
                     <p>R. L. S.</p>
                     <p>I will try again, being a giant refreshed by the house being empty.  The presence of people is the great obstacle to letter-writing.  I deny that letters should contain news (I mean mine; those of other people should).  But mine should contain appropriate sentiments and humorous nonsense, or nonsense without the humour.  When the house is empty, the mind is seized with a desire—no, that is too strong—a willingness to pour forth unmitigated rot, which constitutes (in me) the true spirit of correspondence.  When I have no remarks to offer (and nobody to offer them to), my pen flies, and you see the remarkable consequence of a page literally covered with words and genuinely devoid of sense.  I can always do that, if quite alone, and I like doing it; but I have yet to learn that it is beloved by correspondents.  The deuce of it is, that there is no end possible but the end of the paper; and as there is very little left of that—if I cannot stop writing—suppose you give up reading.  It would all come to the same thing; and I think we should all be happier . . .</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR LOW,—<hi rend="italic">Lamia</hi> has come, and I do not know how to thank you, not only for the beautiful art of the designs, but for the handsome and apt words of the dedication.  My favourite is ‘Bathes unseen,’ which is a masterpiece; and the next, ‘Into the green recessed woods,’ is perhaps more remarkable, though it does not take my fancy so imperiously.  The night scene at Corinth pleases me also.  The second part offers fewer opportunities.  I own I should like to see both <hi rend="italic">Isabella</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Eve</hi> thus illustrated; and then there’s <hi rend="italic">Hyperion</hi>—O, yes, and <hi rend="italic">Endymion</hi>!  I should like to see the lot: beautiful pictures dance before me by hundreds: I believe <hi rend="italic">Endymion</hi> would suit you best.  It also is in faery-land; and I see a hundred opportunities, cloudy and flowery glories, things as delicate as the cobweb in the bush; actions, not in themselves of any mighty purport, but made for the pencil: the feast of Pan, Peona’s isle, the ‘slabbed margin of a well,’ the chase of the butterfly, the nymph, Glaucus, Cybele, Sleep on his couch, a farrago of unconnected beauties.  But I divagate; and all this sits in the bosom of the publisher.</p>
                     <p>What is more important, I accept the terms of the dedication with a frank heart, and the terms of your Latin legend fairly.  The sight of your pictures has once more awakened me to my right mind; something may come of it; yet one more bold push to get free of this prisonyard of the abominably ugly, where I take my daily exercise with my contemporaries.  I do not know, I have a feeling in my bones, a sentiment which may take on the forms of imagination, or may not.  If it does, I shall owe it to you; and the thing will thus descend from Keats even if on the wrong side of the blanket.  If it can be done in prose—that is the puzzle—I divagate again.  Thank you again: you can draw and yet you do not love the ugly: what are you doing in this age?  Flee, while it is yet time; they will have your four limbs pinned upon a stable door to scare witches.  The ugly, my unhappy friend, is <hi rend="italic">de rigueur</hi>: it is the only wear!  What a chance you threw away with the serpent!  Why had Apollonius no pimples?  Heavens, my dear Low, you do not know your business. . . .</p>
                     <p>I send you herewith a Gothic gnome for your Greek nymph; but the gnome is interesting, I think, and he came out of a deep mine, where he guards the fountain of tears.  It is not always the time to rejoice.—Yours ever,</p>
                     <p>R. L. S.</p>
                     <p>The gnome’s name is <hi rend="italic">Jekyll &amp; Hyde</hi>; I believe you will find he is likewise quite willing to answer to the name of Low or Stevenson.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Same day</hi>.—I have copied out on the other sheet some bad verses, which somehow your picture suggested; as a kind of image of things that I pursue and cannot reach, and that you seem—no, not to have reached—but to have come a thought nearer to than I.  This is the life we have chosen: well, the choice was mad, but I should make it again.</p>
                     <p>What occurs to me is this: perhaps they might be printed in (say) the <hi rend="italic">Century</hi> for the sake of my name; and if that were possible, they might advertise your book.  It might be headed as sent in acknowledgment of your <hi rend="italic">Lamia</hi>.  Or perhaps it might be introduced by the phrases I have marked above.  I dare say they would stick it in: I want no payment, being well paid by <hi rend="italic">Lamia</hi>.  If they are not, keep them to yourself.</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR GOSSE,—Thank you for your letter, so interesting to my vanity.  There is a review in the St. James’s, which, as it seems to hold somewhat of your opinions, and is besides written with a pen and not a poker, we think may possibly be yours.  The <hi rend="italic">Prince</hi> 
                        <ref target="#6855990405419608431_637-h-3.htm.xhtml#footnote12">[12]</ref> has done fairly well in spite of the reviews, which have been bad: he was, as you doubtless saw, well slated in the <hi rend="italic">Saturday</hi>; one paper received it as a child’s story; another (picture my agony) described it as a ‘Gilbert comedy.’  It was amusing to see the race between me and Justin M’Carthy: the Milesian has won by a length.</p>
                     <p>That is the hard part of literature.  You aim high, and you take longer over your work, and it will not be so successful as if you had aimed low and rushed it.  What the public likes is work (of any kind) a little loosely executed; so long as it is a little wordy, a little slack, a little dim and knotless, the dear public likes it; it should (if possible) be a little dull into the bargain.  I know that good work sometimes hits; but, with my hand on my heart, I think it is by an accident.  And I know also that good work must succeed at last; but that is not the doing of the public; they are only shamed into silence or affectation.  I do not write for the public; I do write for money, a nobler deity; and most of all for myself, not perhaps any more noble, but both more intelligent and nearer home.</p>
                     <p>Let us tell each other sad stories of the bestiality of the beast whom we feed.  What he likes is the newspaper; and to me the press is the mouth of a sewer, where lying is professed as from an university chair, and everything prurient, and ignoble, and essentially dull, finds its abode and pulpit.  I do not like mankind; but men, and not all of these—and fewer women.  As for respecting the race, and, above all, that fatuous rabble of burgesses called ‘the public,’ God save me from such irreligion!—that way lies disgrace and dishonour.  There must be something wrong in me, or I would not be popular.</p>
                     <p>This is perhaps a trifle stronger than my sedate and permanent opinion.  Not much, I think.  As for the art that we practise, I have never been able to see why its professors should be respected.  They chose the primrose path; when they found it was not all primroses, but some of it brambly, and much of it uphill, they began to think and to speak of themselves as holy martyrs.  But a man is never martyred in any honest sense in the pursuit of his pleasure; and <hi rend="italic">delirium tremens</hi> has more of the honour of the cross.  We were full of the pride of life, and chose, like prostitutes, to live by a pleasure.  We should be paid if we give the pleasure we pretend to give; but why should we be honoured?</p>
                     <p>I hope some day you and Mrs. Gosse will come for a Sunday; but we must wait till I am able to see people.  I am very full of Jenkin’s life; it is painful, yet very pleasant, to dig into the past of a dead friend, and find him, at every spadeful, shine brighter.  I own, as I read, I wonder more and more why he should have taken me to be a friend.  He had many and obvious faults upon the face of him; the heart was pure gold.  I feel it little pain to have lost him, for it is a loss in which I cannot believe; I take it, against reason, for an absence; if not to-day, then to-morrow, I still fancy I shall see him in the door; and then, now when I know him better, how glad a meeting!  Yes, if I could believe in the immortality business, the world would indeed be too good to be true; but we were put here to do what service we can, for honour and not for hire: the sods cover us, and the worm that never dies, the conscience, sleeps well at last; these are the wages, besides what we receive so lavishly day by day; and they are enough for a man who knows his own frailty and sees all things in the proportion of reality.  The soul of piety was killed long ago by that idea of reward.  Nor is happiness, whether eternal or temporal, the reward that mankind seeks.  Happinesses are but his wayside campings; his soul is in the journey; he was born for the struggle, and only tastes his life in effort and on the condition that he is opposed.  How, then, is such a creature, so fiery, so pugnacious, so made up of discontent and aspiration, and such noble and uneasy passions—how can he be rewarded but by rest?  I would not say it aloud; for man’s cherished belief is that he loves that happiness which he continually spurns and passes by; and this belief in some ulterior happiness exactly fits him.  He does not require to stop and taste it; he can be about the rugged and bitter business where his heart lies; and yet he can tell himself this fairy tale of an eternal tea-party, and enjoy the notion that he is both himself and something else; and that his friends will yet meet him, all ironed out and emasculate, and still be lovable,—as if love did not live in the faults of the beloved only, and draw its breath in an unbroken round of forgiveness!  But the truth is, we must fight until we die; and when we die there can be no quiet for mankind but complete resumption into—what?—God, let us say—when all these desperate tricks will lie spellbound at last.</p>

                     <p>DEAR JAMES PAYN,—Your very kind letter came very welcome; and still more welcome the news that you see —’s tale.  I will now tell you (and it was very good and very wise of me not to tell it before) that he is one of the most unlucky men I know, having put all his money into a pharmacy at Hyères, when the cholera (certainly not his fault) swept away his customers in a body.  Thus you can imagine the pleasure I have to announce to him a spark of hope, for he sits to-day in his pharmacy, doing nothing and taking nothing, and watching his debts inexorably mount up.</p>
                     <p>To pass to other matters: your hand, you are perhaps aware, is not one of those that can be read running; and the name of your daughter remains for me undecipherable.  I call her, then, your daughter—and a very good name too—and I beg to explain how it came about that I took her house.  The hospital was a point in my tale; but there is a house on each side.  Now the true house is the one before the hospital: is that No. 11?  If not, what do you complain of?  If it is, how can I help what is true?  Everything in the <hi rend="italic">Dynamiter</hi> is not true; but the story of the Brown Box is, in almost every particular; I lay my hand on my heart and swear to it.  It took place in that house in 1884; and if your daughter was in that house at the time, all I can say is she must have kept very bad society.</p>
                     <p>But I see you coming.  Perhaps your daughter’s house has not a balcony at the back?  I cannot answer for that; I only know that side of Queen Square from the pavement and the back windows of Brunswick Row.  Thence I saw plenty of balconies (terraces rather); and if there is none to the particular house in question, it must have been so arranged to spite me.</p>
                     <p>I now come to the conclusion of this matter.  I address three questions to your daughter:—</p>
                     <p>1st.   Has her house the proper terrace?</p>
                     <p>2nd.  Is it on the proper side of the hospital?</p>
                     <p>3rd.  Was she there in the summer of 1884?</p>
                     <p>You see, I begin to fear that Mrs. Desborough may have deceived me on some trifling points, for she is not a lady of peddling exactitude.  If this should prove to be so, I will give your daughter a proper certificate, and her house property will return to its original value.</p>
                     <p>Can man say more?—Yours very truly,</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR LOW,—I send you two photographs: they are both done by Sir Percy Shelley, the poet’s son, which may interest.  The sitting down one is, I think, the best; but if they choose that, see that the little reflected light on the nose does not give me a turn-up; that would be tragic.  Don’t forget ‘Baronet’ to Sir Percy’s name.</p>
                     <p>We all think a heap of your book; and I am well pleased with my dedication.—Yours ever,</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">P.S.</hi>—<hi rend="italic">Apropos</hi> of the odd controversy about Shelley’s nose: I have before me four photographs of myself, done by Shelley’s son: my nose is hooked, not like the eagle, indeed, but like the accipitrine family in man: well, out of these four, only one marks the bend, one makes it straight, and one suggests a turn-up.  This throws a flood of light on calumnious man—and the scandal-mongering sun.  For personally I cling to my curve.  To continue the Shelley controversy: I have a look of him, all his sisters had noses like mine; Sir Percy has a marked hook; all the family had high cheek-bones like mine; what doubt, then, but that this turn-up (of which Jeaffreson accuses the poet, along with much other <hi rend="italic">fatras</hi>) is the result of some accident similar to what has happened in my photographs by his son?</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR FATHER,—Many thanks for a letter quite like yourself.  I quite agree with you, and had already planned a scene of religion in <hi rend="italic">Balfour</hi>; the Society for the Propagation of Christian Knowledge furnishes me with a catechist whom I shall try to make the man.  I have another catechist, the blind, pistol-carrying highway robber, whom I have transferred from the Long Island to Mull.  I find it a most picturesque period, and wonder Scott let it escape.  The <hi rend="italic">Covenant</hi> is lost on one of the Tarrans, and David is cast on Earraid, where (being from inland) he is nearly starved before he finds out the island is tidal; then he crosses Mull to Toronsay, meeting the blind catechist by the way; then crosses Morven from Kinlochaline to Kingairloch, where he stays the night with the good catechist; that is where I am; next day he is to be put ashore in Appin, and be present at Colin Campbell’s death.  To-day I rest, being a little run down.  Strange how liable we are to brain fag in this scooty family!  But as far as I have got, all but the last chapter, I think David is on his feet, and (to my mind) a far better story and far sounder at heart than <hi rend="italic">Treasure Island</hi>.</p>
                     <p>I have no earthly news, living entirely in my story, and only coming out of it to play patience.  The Shelleys are gone; the Taylors kinder than can be imagined.  The other day, Lady Taylor drove over and called on me; she is a delightful old lady, and great fun.  I mentioned a story about the Duchess of Wellington which I had heard Sir Henry tell; and though he was very tired, he looked it up and copied it out for me in his own hand.—Your most affectionate son,</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR STODDARD,—I am a dreadful character; but, you see, I have at last taken pen in hand; how long I may hold it, God knows.  This is already my sixth letter to-day, and I have many more waiting; and my wrist gives me a jog on the subject of scrivener’s cramp, which is not encouraging.</p>
                     <p>I gather you were a little down in the jaw when you wrote your last.  I am as usual pretty cheerful, but not very strong.  I stay in the house all winter, which is base; but, as you continue to see, the pen goes from time to time, though neither fast enough nor constantly enough to please me.</p>
                     <p>My wife is at Bath with my father and mother, and the interval of widowery explains my writing.  Another person writing for you when you have done work is a great enemy to correspondence.  To-day I feel out of health, and shan’t work; and hence this so much overdue reply.</p>
                     <p>I was re-reading some of your South Sea Idyls the other day: some of the chapters are very good indeed; some pages as good as they can be.</p>
                     <p>How does your class get along?  If you like to touch on <hi rend="italic">Otto</hi>, any day in a by-hour, you may tell them—as the author’s last dying confession—that it is a strange example of the difficulty of being ideal in an age of realism; that the unpleasant giddy-mindedness, which spoils the book and often gives it a wanton air of unreality and juggling with air-bells, comes from unsteadiness of key; from the too great realism of some chapters and passages—some of which I have now spotted, others I dare say I shall never spot—which disprepares the imagination for the cast of the remainder.</p>
                     <p>Any story can be made <hi rend="italic">true</hi> in its own key; any story can be made <hi rend="italic">false</hi> by the choice of a wrong key of detail or style: Otto is made to reel like a drunken—I was going to say man, but let us substitute cipher—by the variations of the key.  Have you observed that the famous problem of realism and idealism is one purely of detail?  Have you seen my ‘Note on Realism’ in Cassell’s <hi rend="italic">Magazine of Art</hi>; and ‘Elements of Style’ in the <hi rend="italic">Contemporary</hi>; and ‘Romance’ and ‘Humble Apology’ in <hi rend="italic">Longman’s</hi>?  They are all in your line of business; let me know what you have not seen and I’ll send ’em.</p>
                     <p>I am glad I brought the old house up to you.  It was a pleasant old spot, and I remember you there, though still more dearly in your own strange den upon a hill in San Francisco; and one of the most San Francisco-y parts of San Francisco.</p>
                     <p>Good-bye, my dear fellow, and believe me your friend,</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR SYMONDS,—If we have lost touch, it is (I think) only in a material sense; a question of letters, not hearts.  You will find a warm welcome at Skerryvore from both the lightkeepers; and, indeed, we never tell ourselves one of our financial fairy tales, but a run to Davos is a prime feature.  I am not changeable in friendship; and I think I can promise you you have a pair of trusty well-wishers and friends in Bournemouth: whether they write or not is but a small thing; the flag may not be waved, but it is there.</p>
                     <p>Jekyll is a dreadful thing, I own; but the only thing I feel dreadful about is that damned old business of the war in the members.  This time it came out; I hope it will stay in, in future.</p>
                     <p>Raskolnikoff <ref target="#6855990405419608431_637-h-3.htm.xhtml#footnote20">[20]</ref> is easily the greatest book I have read in ten years; I am glad you took to it.  Many find it dull: Henry James could not finish it: all I can say is, it nearly finished me.  It was like having an illness.  James did not care for it because the character of Raskolnikoff was not objective; and at that I divined a great gulf between us, and, on further reflection, the existence of a certain impotence in many minds of to-day, which prevents them from living <hi rend="italic">in</hi> a book or a character, and keeps them standing afar off, spectators of a puppet show.  To such I suppose the book may seem empty in the centre; to the others it is a room, a house of life, into which they themselves enter, and are tortured and purified.  The Juge d’Instruction I thought a wonderful, weird, touching, ingenious creation: the drunken father, and Sonia, and the student friend, and the uncircumscribed, protaplasmic humanity of Raskolnikoff, all upon a level that filled me with wonder: the execution also, superb in places.  Another has been translated—<hi rend="italic">Humiliés et Offensés</hi>.  It is even more incoherent than <hi rend="italic">Le Crime et le Châtiment</hi>, but breathes much of the same lovely goodness, and has passages of power.  Dostoieffsky is a devil of a swell, to be sure.  Have you heard that he became a stout, imperialist conservative?  It is interesting to know.  To something of that side, the balance leans with me also in view of the incoherency and incapacity of all.  The old boyish idea of the march on Paradise being now out of season, and all plans and ideas that I hear debated being built on a superb indifference to the first principles of human character, a helpless desire to acquiesce in anything of which I know the worst assails me.  Fundamental errors in human nature of two sorts stand on the skyline of all this modern world of aspirations.  First, that it is happiness that men want; and second, that happiness consists of anything but an internal harmony.  Men do not want, and I do not think they would accept, happiness; what they live for is rivalry, effort, success—the elements our friends wish to eliminate.  And, on the other hand, happiness is a question of morality—or of immorality, there is no difference—and conviction.  Gordon was happy in Khartoum, in his worst hours of danger and fatigue; Marat was happy, I suppose, in his ugliest frenzy; Marcus Aurelius was happy in the detested camp; Pepys was pretty happy, and I am pretty happy on the whole, because we both somewhat crowingly accepted a <hi rend="italic">via media</hi>, both liked to attend to our affairs, and both had some success in managing the same.  It is quite an open question whether Pepys and I ought to be happy; on the other hand, there is no doubt that Marat had better be unhappy.  He was right (if he said it) that he was <hi rend="italic">la misère humaine</hi>, cureless misery—unless perhaps by the gallows.  Death is a great and gentle solvent; it has never had justice done it, no, not by Whitman.  As for those crockery chimney-piece ornaments, the bourgeois (<hi rend="italic">quorum pars</hi>), and their cowardly dislike of dying and killing, it is merely one symptom of a thousand how utterly they have got out of touch of life.  Their dislike of capital punishment and their treatment of their domestic servants are for me the two flaunting emblems of their hollowness.</p>
                     <p>God knows where I am driving to.  But here comes my lunch.</p>
                     <p>Which interruption, happily for you, seems to have stayed the issue.  I have now nothing to say, that had formerly such a pressure of twaddle.  Pray don’t fail to come this summer.  It will be a great disappointment, now it has been spoken of, if you do.—Yours ever,</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR LOW,—This is the most enchanting picture.  Now understand my state: I am really an invalid, but of a mysterious order.  I might be a <hi rend="italic">malade imaginaire</hi>, but for one too tangible symptom, my tendency to bleed from the lungs.  If we could go, (1<hi rend="italic">st</hi>)  We must have money enough to travel with <hi rend="italic">leisure and comfort</hi>—especially the first.  (<hi rend="italic">2nd</hi>)  You must be prepared for a comrade who would go to bed some part of every day and often stay silent (3<hi rend="italic">rd</hi>)  You would have to play the part of a thoughtful courier, sparing me fatigue, looking out that my bed was warmed, etc. (4<hi rend="italic">th</hi>)  If you are very nervous, you must recollect a bad hæmorrhage is always on the cards, with its concomitants of anxiety and horror for those who are beside me.</p>
                     <p>Do you blench?  If so, let us say no more about it.</p>
                     <p>If you are still unafraid, and the money were forthcoming, I believe the trip might do me good, and I feel sure that, working together, we might produce a fine book.  The Rhone is the river of Angels.  I adore it: have adored it since I was twelve, and first saw it from the train.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, it would depend on how I keep from now on.  I have stood the winter hitherto with some credit, but the dreadful weather still continues, and I cannot holloa till I am through the wood.</p>
                     <p>Subject to these numerous and gloomy provisos, I embrace the prospect with glorious feelings.</p>
                     <p>I write this from bed, snow pouring without, and no circumstance of pleasure except your letter.  That, however, counts for much.  I am glad you liked the doggerel: I have already had a liberal cheque, over which I licked my fingers with a sound conscience.  I had not meant to make money by these stumbling feet, but if it comes, it is only too welcome in my handsome but impecunious house.</p>
                     <p>Let me know soon what is to be expected—as far as it does not hang by that inconstant quantity, my want of health.  Remember me to Madam with the best thanks and wishes; and believe me your friend,</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR MRS. JENKIN,—I try to tell myself it is good nature, but I know it is vanity that makes me write.</p>
                     <p>I have drafted the first part of Chapter VI., Fleeming and his friends, his influence on me, his views on religion and literature, his part at the Savile; it should boil down to about ten pages, and I really do think it admirably good.  It has so much evoked Fleeming for myself that I found my conscience stirred just as it used to be after a serious talk with him: surely that means it is good?  I had to write and tell you, being alone.</p>
                     <p>I have excellent news of Fanny, who is much better for the change.  My father is still very yellow, and very old, and very weak, but yesterday he seemed happier, and smiled, and followed what was said; even laughed, I think.  When he came away, he said to me, ‘Take care of yourself, my dearie,’ which had a strange sound of childish days, and will not leave my mind.</p>
                     <p>You must get Litolf’s <hi rend="italic">Gavottes Célèbres</hi>: I have made another trover there: a musette of Lully’s.  The second part of it I have not yet got the hang of; but the first—only a few bars!  The gavotte is beautiful and pretty hard, I think, and very much of the period; and at the end of it, this musette enters with the most really thrilling effect of simple beauty.  O—it’s first-rate.  I am quite mad over it.  If you find other books containing Lully, Rameau, Martini, please let me know; also you might tell me, you who know Bach, where the easiest is to be found.  I write all morning, come down, and never leave the piano till about five; write letters, dine, get down again about eight, and never leave the piano till I go to bed.  This is a fine life.—Yours most sincerely,</p>
                     <p>R. L. S.</p>
                     <p>If you get the musette (Lully’s), please tell me if I am right, and it was probably written for strings.  Anyway, it is as neat as—as neat as Bach—on the piano; or seems so to my ignorance.</p>
                     <p>I play much of the Rigadoon but it is strange, it don’t come off <hi rend="italic">quite</hi> so well with me!</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR FATHER,—The David problem has to-day been decided.  I am to leave the door open for a sequel if the public take to it, and this will save me from butchering a lot of good material to no purpose.  Your letter from Carlisle was pretty like yourself, sir, as I was pleased to see; the hand of Jekyll, not the hand of Hyde.  I am for action quite unfit, and even a letter is beyond me; so pray take these scraps at a vast deal more than their intrinsic worth.  I am in great spirits about David, Colvin agreeing with Henley, Fanny, and myself in thinking it far the most human of my labours hitherto.  As to whether the long-eared British public may take to it, all think it more than doubtful; I wish they would, for I could do a second volume with ease and pleasure, and Colvin thinks it sin and folly to throw away David and Alan Breck upon so small a field as this one.—Ever your affectionate son,</p>

                     <p>[<hi rend="italic">Skerryvore</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Bournemouth</hi>], <hi rend="italic">April</hi> 15 <hi rend="italic">or</hi> 16 (<hi rend="italic">the hour not being known</hi>), 1886.</p>
                     <p>MY DEAR MRS. JENKIN,—It is I know not what hour of the night; but I cannot sleep, have lit the gas, and here goes.</p>
                     <p>First, all your packet arrived: I have dipped into the Schumann already with great pleasure.  Surely, in what concerns us there is a sweet little chirrup; the <hi rend="italic">Good Words</hi> arrived in the morning just when I needed it, and the famous notes that I had lost were recovered also in the nick of time.</p>
                     <p>And now I am going to bother you with my affairs: premising, first, that this is <hi rend="italic">private</hi>; second, that whatever I do the <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> shall be done first, and I am getting on with it well; and third, that I do not quite know why I consult you, but something tells me you will hear with fairness.</p>
                     <p>Here is my problem.  The Curtin women are still miserable prisoners; no one dare buy their farm of them, all the manhood of England and the world stands aghast before a threat of murder.  (1) Now, my work can be done anywhere; hence I can take up without loss a back-going Irish farm, and live on, though not (as I had originally written) in it: First Reason.  (2) If I should be killed, there are a good many who would feel it: writers are so much in the public eye, that a writer being murdered would attract attention, throw a bull’s-eye light upon this cowardly business: Second Reason.  (3) I am not unknown in the States, from which the funds come that pay for these brutalities: to some faint extent, my death (if I should be killed) would tell there: Third Reason.  (4) <hi rend="italic">Nobody else is taking up this obvious and crying duly</hi>: Fourth Reason.  (5) I have a crazy health and may die at any moment, my life is of no purchase in an insurance office, it is the less account to husband it, and the business of husbanding a life is dreary and demoralising: Fifth Reason.</p>
                     <p>I state these in no order, but as they occur to me.  And I shall do the like with the objections.</p>
                     <p>First Objection: It will do no good; you have seen Gordon die and nobody minded; nobody will mind if you die.  This is plainly of the devil.  Second Objection: You will not even be murdered, the climate will miserably kill you, you will strangle out in a rotten damp heat, in congestion, etc.  Well, what then?  It changes nothing: the purpose is to brave crime; let me brave it, for such time and to such an extent as God allows.  Third Objection: The Curtin women are probably highly uninteresting females.  I haven’t a doubt of it.  But the Government cannot, men will not, protect them.  If I am the only one to see this public duty, it is to the public and the Right I should perform it—not to Mesdames Curtin.  Fourth Objection: I am married.  ‘I have married a wife!’  I seem to have heard it before.  It smells ancient! what was the context?  Fifth Objection: My wife has had a mean life (1), loves me (2), could not bear to lose me (3).  (1) I admit: I am sorry.  (2) But what does she love me for? and (3) she must lose me soon or late.  And after all, because we run this risk, it does not follow we should fail.  Sixth Objection: My wife wouldn’t like it.  No, she wouldn’t.  Who would?  But the Curtins don’t like it.  And all those who are to suffer if this goes on, won’t like it.  And if there is a great wrong, somebody must suffer.  Seventh Objection: I won’t like it.  No, I will not; I have thought it through, and I will not.  But what of that?  And both she and I may like it more than we suppose.  We shall lose friends, all comforts, all society: so has everybody who has ever done anything; but we shall have some excitement, and that’s a fine thing; and we shall be trying to do the right, and that’s not to be despised.  Eighth Objection: I am an author with my work before me.  See Second Reason.  Ninth Objection: But am I not taken with the hope of excitement?  I was at first.  I am not much now.  I see what a dreary, friendless, miserable, God-forgotten business it will be.  And anyway, is not excitement the proper reward of doing anything both right and a little dangerous?  Tenth Objection: But am I not taken with a notion of glory?  I dare say I am.  Yet I see quite clearly how all points to nothing coming, to a quite inglorious death by disease and from the lack of attendance; or even if I should be knocked on the head, as these poor Irish promise, how little any one will care.  It will be a smile at a thousand breakfast-tables.  I am nearly forty now; I have not many illusions.  And if I had?  I do not love this health-tending, housekeeping life of mine.  I have a taste for danger, which is human, like the fear of it.  Here is a fair cause; a just cause; no knight ever set lance in rest for a juster.  Yet it needs not the strength I have not, only the passive courage that I hope I could muster, and the watchfulness that I am sure I could learn.</p>
                     <p>Here is a long midnight dissertation; with myself; with you.  Please let me hear.  But I charge you this: if you see in this idea of mine the finger of duty, do not dissuade me.  I am nearing forty, I begin to love my ease and my home and my habits, I never knew how much till this arose; do not falsely counsel me to put my head under the bed-clothes.  And I will say this to you: my wife, who hates the idea, does not refuse.  ‘It is nonsense,’ says she, ‘but if you go, I will go.’  Poor girl, and her home and her garden that she was so proud of!  I feel her garden most of all, because it is a pleasure (I suppose) that I do not feel myself to share.</p>
                     <p>1.  Here is a great wrong.</p>
                     <p>2.  ,, growing wrong.</p>
                     <p>3.  ,, wrong founded on crime.</p>
                     <p>4.  ,, crime that the Government cannot prevent.</p>
                     <p>5.  ,, crime that it occurs to no man to defy.</p>
                     <p>6.  But it has occurred to me.</p>
                     <p>7.  Being a known person, some will notice my defiance.</p>
                     <p>8.  Being a writer, I can <hi rend="italic">make</hi> people notice it.</p>
                     <p>9.  And, I think, <hi rend="italic">make</hi> people imitate me.</p>
                     <p>10.  Which would destroy in time this whole scaffolding of oppression.</p>
                     <p>11.  And if I fail, however ignominiously, that is not my concern.  It is, with an odd mixture of reverence and humorous remembrances of Dickens, be it said—it is A-nother’s.</p>
                     <p>And here, at I cannot think what hour of the morning, I shall dry up, and remain,—Yours, really in want of a little help,</p>
                     <p>R. L S.</p>

                     <p>[<hi rend="italic">Skerryvore</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Bournemouth</hi>, <hi rend="italic">April</hi> 1886.]</p>
                     <p>MY DEAR MRS. JENKIN,—The Book—It is all drafted: I hope soon to send you for comments Chapters III., IV., and V.  Chapter VII. is roughly but satisfactorily drafted: a very little work should put that to rights.  But Chapter VI. is no joke; it is a <hi rend="italic">mare magnum</hi>: I swim and drown and come up again; and it is all broken ends and mystification: moreover, I perceive I am in want of more matter.  I must have, first of all, a little letter from Mr. Ewing about the phonograph work: <hi rend="italic">If</hi> you think he would understand it is quite a matter of chance whether I use a word or a fact out of it.  If you think he would not: I will go without.  Also, could I have a look at Ewing’s <hi rend="italic">précis</hi>?  And lastly, I perceive I must interview you again about a few points; they are very few, and might come to little; and I propose to go on getting things as well together as I can in the meanwhile, and rather have a final time when all is ready and only to be criticised.  I do still think it will be good.  I wonder if Trélat would let me cut?  But no, I think I wouldn’t after all; ’tis so quaint and pretty and clever and simple and French, and gives such a good sight of Fleeming: the plum of the book, I think.</p>
                     <p>You misunderstood me in one point: I always hoped to found such a society; that was the outside of my dream, and would mean entire success.  <hi rend="italic">But</hi>—I cannot play Peter the Hermit.  In these days of the Fleet Street journalist, I cannot send out better men than myself, with wives or mothers just as good as mine, and sisters (I may at least say) better, to a danger and a long-drawn dreariness that I do not share.  My wife says it’s cowardice; what brave men are the leader-writers!  Call it cowardice; it is mine.  Mind you, I may end by trying to do it by the pen only: I shall not love myself if I do; and is it ever a good thing to do a thing for which you despise yourself?—even in the doing?  And if the thing you do is to call upon others to do the thing you neglect?  I have never dared to say what I feel about men’s lives, because my own was in the wrong: shall I dare to send them to death?  The physician must heal himself; he must honestly <hi rend="italic">try</hi> the path he recommends: if he does not even try, should he not be silent?</p>
                     <p>I thank you very heartily for your letter, and for the seriousness you brought to it.  You know, I think when a serious thing is your own, you keep a saner man by laughing at it and yourself as you go.  So I do not write possibly with all the really somewhat sickened gravity I feel.  And indeed, what with the book, and this business to which I referred, and Ireland, I am scarcely in an enviable state.  Well, I ought to be glad, after ten years of the worst training on earth—valetudinarianism—that I can still be troubled by a duty.  You shall hear more in time; so far, I am at least decided: I will go and see Balfour when I get to London.</p>
                     <p>We have all had a great pleasure: a Mrs. Rawlinson came and brought with her a nineteen-year-old daughter, simple, human, as beautiful as—herself; I never admired a girl before, you know it was my weakness: we are all three dead in love with her.  How nice to be able to do so much good to harassed people by—yourself!  Ever yours,</p>

                     <p>DEAR MISS MONROE,—(I hope I have this rightly) I must lose no time in thanking you for a letter singularly pleasant to receive.  It may interest you to know that I read to the signature without suspecting my correspondent was a woman; though in one point (a reference to the Countess) I might have found a hint of the truth.  You are not pleased with Otto; since I judge you do not like weakness; and no more do I.  And yet I have more than tolerance for Otto, whose faults are the faults of weakness, but never of ignoble weakness, and who seeks before all to be both kind and just.  Seeks, not succeeds.  But what is man?  So much of cynicism to recognise that nobody does right is the best equipment for those who do not wish to be cynics in good earnest.  Think better of Otto, if my plea can influence you; and this I mean for your own sake—not his, poor fellow, as he will never learn your opinion; but for yours, because, as men go in this world (and women too), you will not go far wrong if you light upon so fine a fellow; and to light upon one and not perceive his merits is a calamity.  In the flesh, of course, I mean; in the book the fault, of course, is with my stumbling pen.  Seraphina made a mistake about her Otto; it begins to swim before me dimly that you may have some traits of Seraphina?</p>
                     <p>With true ingratitude you see me pitch upon your exception; but it is easier to defend oneself gracefully than to acknowledge praise.  I am truly glad that you should like my books; for I think I see from what you write that you are a reader worth convincing.  Your name, if I have properly deciphered it, suggests that you may be also something of my countrywoman; for it is hard to see where Monroe came from, if not from Scotland.  I seem to have here a double claim on your good nature: being myself pure Scotch and having appreciated your letter, make up two undeniable merits which, perhaps, if it should be quite without trouble, you might reward with your photograph.—Yours truly,</p>
                     <p>Robert Louis Stevenson.</p>

                     <p>[<hi rend="italic">Skerryvore</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Bournemouth</hi>, <hi rend="italic">June</hi> 1886.]</p>
                     <p>MY DEAR MISS MONROE,—I am ill in bed and stupid, incoherently stupid; yet I have to answer your letter, and if the answer is incomprehensible you must forgive me.  You say my letter caused you pleasure; I am sure, as it fell out, not near so much as yours has brought to me.  The interest taken in an author is fragile: his next book, or your next year of culture, might see the interest frosted or outgrown; and himself, in spite of all, you might probably find the most distasteful person upon earth.  My case is different.  I have bad health, am often condemned to silence for days together—was so once for six weeks, so that my voice was awful to hear when I first used it, like the whisper of a shadow—have outlived all my chief pleasures, which were active and adventurous, and ran in the open air: and being a person who prefers life to art, and who knows it is a far finer thing to be in love, or to risk a danger, than to paint the finest picture or write the noblest book, I begin to regard what remains to me of my life as very shadowy.  From a variety of reasons, I am ashamed to confess I was much in this humour when your letter came.  I had a good many troubles; was regretting a high average of sins; had been recently reminded that I had outlived some friends, and wondering if I had not outlived some friendships; and had just, while boasting of better health, been struck down again by my haunting enemy, an enemy who was exciting at first, but has now, by the iteration of his strokes, become merely annoying and inexpressibly irksome.  Can you fancy that to a person drawing towards the elderly this sort of conjunction of circumstances brings a rather aching sense of the past and the future?  Well, it was just then that your letter and your photograph were brought to me in bed; and there came to me at once the most agreeable sense of triumph.  My books were still young; my words had their good health and could go about the world and make themselves welcome; and even (in a shadowy and distant sense) make something in the nature of friends for the sheer hulk that stays at home and bites his pen over the manuscripts.  It amused me very much to remember that I had been in Chicago, not so many years ago, in my proper person; where I had failed to awaken much remark, except from the ticket collector; and to think how much more gallant and persuasive were the fellows that I now send instead of me, and how these are welcome in that quarter to the sitter of Herr Platz, while their author was not very welcome even in the villainous restaurant where he tried to eat a meal and rather failed.</p>
                     <p>And this leads me directly to a confession.  The photograph which shall accompany this is not chosen as the most like, but the best-looking.  Put yourself in my place, and you will call this pardonable.  Even as it is, even putting forth a flattered presentment, I am a little pained; and very glad it is a photograph and not myself that has to go; for in this case, if it please you, you can tell yourself it is my image—and if it displeased you, you can lay the blame on the photographer; but in that, there were no help, and the poor author might belie his labours.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Kidnapped</hi> should soon appear; I am afraid you may not like it, as it is very unlike <hi rend="italic">Prince Otto</hi> in every way; but I am myself a great admirer of the two chief characters, Alan and David.  <hi rend="italic">Virginibus Puerisque</hi> has never been issued in the States.  I do not think it is a book that has much charm for publishers in any land; but I am to bring out a new edition in England shortly, a copy of which I must try to remember to send you.  I say try to remember, because I have some superficial acquaintance with myself: and I have determined, after a galling discipline, to promise nothing more until the day of my death: at least, in this way, I shall no more break my word, and I must now try being churlish instead of being false.</p>
                     <p>I do not believe you to be the least like Seraphina.  Your photograph has no trace of her, which somewhat relieves me, as I am a good deal afraid of Seraphinas—they do not always go into the woods and see the sunrise, and some are so well-mailed that even that experience would leave them unaffected and unsoftened.  The ‘hair and eyes of several complexions’ was a trait taken from myself; and I do not bind myself to the opinions of Sir John.  In this case, perhaps—but no, if the peculiarity is shared by two such pleasant persons as you and I (as you and me—the grammatical nut is hard), it must be a very good thing indeed, and Sir John must be an ass.</p>
                     <p>The <hi rend="italic">Book Reader</hi> notice was a strange jumble of fact and fancy.  I wish you could have seen my father’s old assistant and present partner when he heard my father described as an ‘inspector of lighthouses,’ for we are all very proud of the family achievements, and the name of my house here in Bournemouth is stolen from one of the sea-towers of the Hebrides which are our pyramids and monuments.  I was never at Cambridge, again; but neglected a considerable succession of classes at Edinburgh.  But to correct that friendly blunderer were to write an autobiography.—And so now, with many thanks, believe me yours sincerely,</p>

                     <p>SIR,—Your foolish letter was unduly received.  There may be hidden fifths, and if there are, it shows how dam spontaneous the thing was.  I could tinker and tic-tac-toe on a piece of paper, but scorned the act with a Threnody, which was poured forth like blood and water on the groaning organ.  If your heart (which was what I addressed) remained unmoved, let us refer to the affair no more: crystallised emotion, the statement and the reconciliation of the sorrows of the race and the individual, is obviously no more to you than supping sawdust.  Well, well.  If ever I write another Threnody!  My next op. will probably be a Passepied and fugue in G (or D).</p>
                     <p>The mind is in my case shrunk to the size and sp. gr. of an aged Spanish filbert.  O, I am so jolly silly.  I now pickle with some freedom (1) the refrain of <hi rend="italic">Martini’s Moutons</hi>; (2) <hi rend="italic">Sul margine d’un rio</hi>, arranged for the infant school by the Aged Statesman; (3) the first phrase of Bach’s musette (Sweet Englishwoman, No. 3), <ref target="#6855990405419608431_637-h-3.htm.xhtml#footnote37">[37]</ref> the rest of the musette being one prolonged cropper, which I take daily for the benefit of my health.  All my other works (of which there are many) are either arranged (by R. L. Stevenson) for the manly and melodious forefinger, or else prolonged and melancholy croppers. . . . I find one can get a notion of music very nicely.  I have been pickling deeply in the Magic Flute; and have arranged <hi rend="italic">La dove prende</hi>, almost to the end, for two melodious forefingers.  I am next going to score the really nobler <hi rend="italic">Colomba o tortorella</hi> for the same instruments.</p>
                     <p>This day is published<lb/>The works of Ludwig van Beethoven<lb/>arranged<lb/>and wiederdurchgearbeiteted<lb/>for two melodious forefingers<lb/>by,<lb/>Sir,—Your obedient servant,</p>
                     <p>Pimperly Stipple.</p>
                     <p>That’s a good idea?  There’s a person called Lenz who actually does it—beware his den; I lost eighteenpennies on him, and found the bleeding corpses of pieces of music divorced from their keys, despoiled of their graces, and even changed in time; I do not wish to regard music (nor to be regarded) through that bony Lenz.  You say you are ‘a spumfed idiot’; but how about Lenz?  And how about me, sir, me?</p>
                     <p>I yesterday sent Lloyd by parcel post, at great expense, an empty matchbox and empty cigarette-paper book, a bell from a cat’s collar, an iron kitchen spoon, and a piece of coal more than half the superficies of this sheet of paper.  They are now (appropriately enough) speeding towards the Silly Isles; I hope he will find them useful.  By that, and my telegram with prepaid answer to yourself, you may judge of my spiritual state.  The finances have much brightened; and if <hi rend="italic">Kidnapped</hi> keeps on as it has begun, I may be solvent.—Yours,</p>

                     <p>DEAR BOB,—Herewith another shy; more melancholy than before, but I think not so abjectly idiotic.  The musical terms seem to be as good as in Beethoven, and that, after all, is the great affair.  Bar the dam bareness of the base, it looks like a piece of real music from a distance.  I am proud to say it was not made one hand at a time; the base was of synchronous birth with the treble; they are of the same age, sir, and may God have mercy on their souls!—Yours,</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR PEOPLE,—It is probably my fault, and not yours, that I did not understand.  I think it would be well worth trying the winter in Bournemouth; but I would only take the house by the month—this after mature discussion.  My leakage still pursues its course; if I were only well, I have a notion to go north and get in (if I could) at the inn at Kirkmichael, which has always smiled upon me much.  If I did well there, we might then meet and do what should most smile at the time.</p>
                     <p>Meanwhile, of course, I must not move, and am in a rancid box here, feeling the heat a great deal, and pretty tired of things.  Alexander did a good thing of me at last; it looks like a mixture of an aztec idol, a lion, an Indian Rajah, and a woman; and certainly represents a mighty comic figure.  F. and Lloyd both think it is the best thing that has been done of me up to now.</p>
                     <p>You should hear Lloyd on the penny whistle, and me on the piano!  Dear powers, what a concerto!  I now live entirely for the piano, he for the whistle; the neighbours, in a radius of a furlong and a half, are packing up in quest of brighter climes.—Ever yours,</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR FATHER,—We have decided not to come to Scotland, but just to do as Dobell wished, and take an outing.  I believe this is wiser in all ways; but I own it is a disappointment.  I am weary of England; like Alan, ‘I weary for the heather,’ if not for the deer.  Lloyd has gone to Scilly with Katharine and C., where and with whom he should have a good time.  David seems really to be going to succeed, which is a pleasant prospect on all sides.  I am, I believe, floated financially; a book that sells will be a pleasant novelty.  I enclose another review; mighty complimentary, and calculated to sell the book too.</p>
                     <p>Coolin’s tombstone has been got out, honest man! and it is to be polished, for it has got scratched, and have a touch of gilding in the letters, and be sunk in the front of the house.  Worthy man, he, too, will maybe weary for the heather, and the bents of Gullane, where (as I dare say you remember) he gaed clean gyte, and jumped on to his crown from a gig, in hot and hopeless chase of many thousand rabbits.  I can still hear the little cries of the honest fellow as he disappeared; and my mother will correct me, but I believe it was two days before he turned up again at North Berwick: to judge by his belly, he had caught not one out of these thousands, but he had had some exercise.</p>
                     <p>I keep well.—Ever your affectionate son,</p>

                     <p>DEAR MR. WATTS, The sight of the last <hi rend="italic">Athenæum</hi> reminds me of you, and of my debt, now too long due.  I wish to thank you for your notice of <hi rend="italic">Kidnapped</hi>; and that not because it was kind, though for that also I valued it, but in the same sense as I have thanked you before now for a hundred articles on a hundred different writers.  A critic like you is one who fights the good fight, contending with stupidity, and I would fain hope not all in vain; in my own case, for instance, surely not in vain.</p>
                     <p>What you say of the two parts in <hi rend="italic">Kidnapped</hi> was felt by no one more painfully than by myself.  I began it partly as a lark, partly as a pot-boiler; and suddenly it moved, David and Alan stepped out from the canvas, and I found I was in another world.  But there was the cursed beginning, and a cursed end must be appended; and our old friend Byles the butcher was plainly audible tapping at the back door.  So it had to go into the world, one part (as it does seem to me) alive, one part merely galvanised: no work, only an essay.  For a man of tentative method, and weak health, and a scarcity of private means, and not too much of that frugality which is the artist’s proper virtue, the days of sinecures and patrons look very golden: the days of professional literature very hard.  Yet I do not so far deceive myself as to think I should change my character by changing my epoch; the sum of virtue in our books is in a relation of equality to the sum of virtues in ourselves; and my <hi rend="italic">Kidnapped</hi> was doomed, while still in the womb and while I was yet in the cradle, to be the thing it is.</p>
                     <p>And now to the more genial business of defence.  You attack my fight on board the <hi rend="italic">Covenant</hi>: I think it literal.  David and Alan had every advantage on their side—position, arms, training, a good conscience; a handful of merchant sailors, not well led in the first attack, not led at all in the second, could only by an accident have taken the round-house by attack; and since the defenders had firearms and food, it is even doubtful if they could have been starved out.  The only doubtful point with me is whether the seamen would have ever ventured on the second onslaught; I half believe they would not; still the illusion of numbers and the authority of Hoseason would perhaps stretch far enough to justify the extremity.—I am, dear Mr. Watts, your very sincere admirer,</p>

                     <p>DEAR LOCKER,—You take my verses too kindly, but you will admit, for such a bluebottle of a versifier to enter the house of Gertrude, where her necklace hangs, was not a little brave.  Your kind invitation, I fear, must remain unaccented; and yet—if I am very well—perhaps next spring—(for I mean to be very well)—my wife might. . . .  But all that is in the clouds with my better health.  And now look here: you are a rich man and know many people, therefore perhaps some of the Governors of Christ’s Hospital.  If you do, I know a most deserving case, in which I would (if I could) do anything.  To approach you, in this way, is not decent; and you may therefore judge by my doing it, how near this matter lies to my heart.  I enclose you a list of the Governors, which I beg you to return, whether or not you shall be able to do anything to help me.</p>
                     <p>The boy’s name is —; he and his mother are very poor.  It may interest you in her cause if I tell you this: that when I was dangerously ill at Hyères, this brave lady, who had then a sick husband of her own (since dead) and a house to keep and a family of four to cook for, all with her own hands, for they could afford no servant, yet took watch-about with my wife, and contributed not only to my comfort, but to my recovery in a degree that I am not able to limit.  You can conceive how much I suffer from my impotence to help her, and indeed I have already shown myself a thankless friend.  Let not my cry go up before you in vain!—Yours in hope,</p>
                     <p>Robert Louis Stevenson.</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR LOCKER,—That I should call myself a man of letters, and land myself in such unfathomable ambiguities!  No, my dear Locker, I did not want a cheque; and in my ignorance of business, which is greater even than my ignorance of literature, I have taken the liberty of drawing a pen through the document and returning it; should this be against the laws of God or man, forgive me.  All that I meant by my excessively disgusting reference to your material well-being was the vague notion that a man who is well off was sure to know a Governor of Christ’s Hospital; though how I quite arrived at this conclusion I do not see.  A man with a cold in the head does not necessarily know a ratcatcher; and the connection is equally close—as it now appears to my awakened and somewhat humbled spirit.  For all that, let me thank you in the warmest manner for your friendly readiness to contribute.  You say you have hopes of becoming a miser: I wish I had; but indeed I believe you deceive yourself, and are as far from it as ever.  I wish I had any excuse to keep your cheque, for it is much more elegant to receive than to return; but I have my way of making it up to you, and I do sincerely beg you to write to the two Governors.  This extraordinary outpouring of correspondence would (if you knew my habits) convince you of my great eagerness in this matter.  I would promise gratitude; but I have made a promise to myself to make no more promises to anybody else, having broken such a host already, and come near breaking my heart in consequence; and as for gratitude, I am by nature a thankless dog, and was spoiled from a child up.  But if you can help this lady in the matter of the Hospital, you will have helped the worthy.  Let me continue to hope that I shall make out my visit in the spring, and believe me, yours very truly,</p>
                     <p>Robert Louis Stevenson.</p>
                     <p>It may amuse you to know that a very long while ago, I broke my heart to try to imitate your verses, and failed hopelessly.  I saw some of the evidences the other day among my papers, and blushed to the heels.</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR LOCKER,—You are simply an angel of light, and your two letters have gone to the post; I trust they will reach the hearts of the recipients—at least, that could not be more handsomely expressed.  About the cheque: well now, I am going to keep it; but I assure you Mrs. — has never asked me for money, and I would not dare to offer any till she did.  For all that I shall stick to the cheque now, and act to that amount as your almoner.  In this way I reward myself for the ambiguity of my epistolary style.</p>
                     <p>I suppose, if you please, you may say your verses are thin (would you so describe an arrow, by the way, and one that struck the gold?  It scarce strikes me as exhaustively descriptive), and, thin or not, they are (and I have found them) inimitably elegant.  I thank you again very sincerely for the generous trouble you have taken in this matter which was so near my heart, and you may be very certain it will be the fault of my health and not my inclination, if I do not see you before very long; for all that has past has made me in more than the official sense sincerely yours,</p>

                     <p>Fanny is pretty peepy; I am splendid.  I have been writing much verse—quite the bard, in fact; and also a dam tale to order, which will be what it will be: I don’t love it, but some of it is passable in its mouldy way, <hi rend="italic">The Misadventures of John Nicholson</hi>.  All my bardly exercises are in Scotch; I have struck my somewhat ponderous guitar in that tongue to no small extent: with what success, I know not, but I think it’s better than my English verse; more marrow and fatness, and more ruggedness.</p>
                     <p>How goes <hi rend="italic">Keats</hi>?  Pray remark, if he (Keats) hung back from Shelley, it was not to be wondered at, <hi rend="italic">when so many of his friends were Shelley’s pensioners</hi>.  I forget if you have made this point; it has been borne in upon me reading Dowden and the <hi rend="italic">Shelley Papers</hi>; and it will do no harm if you have made it.  I finished a poem to-day, and writ 3000 words of a story, <hi rend="italic">tant bien que mal</hi>; and have a right to be sleepy, and (what is far nobler and rarer) am so.—My dear Colvin, ever yours,</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR JAMES,—My health has played me it in once more in the absurdest fashion, and the creature who now addresses you is but a stringy and white-faced <hi rend="italic">bouilli</hi> out of the pot of fever, with the devil to pay in every corner of his economy.  I suppose (to judge by your letter) I need not send you these sheets, which came during my collapse by the rush.  I am on the start with three volumes, that one of tales, <ref target="#6855990405419608431_637-h-3.htm.xhtml#footnote48a">[48a]</ref> a second one of essays, <ref target="#6855990405419608431_637-h-3.htm.xhtml#footnote48b">[48b]</ref> and one of—ahem—verse. <ref target="#6855990405419608431_637-h-3.htm.xhtml#footnote48c">[48c]</ref>  This is a great order, is it not?  After that I shall have empty lockers.  All new work stands still; I was getting on well with Jenkin when this blessed malady unhorsed me, and sent me back to the dung-collecting trade of the republisher.  I shall re-issue <hi rend="italic">Virg. Puer.</hi> as Vol. I. of <hi rend="italic">Essays</hi>, and the new vol. as Vol. II. of ditto; to be sold, however, separately.  This is but a dry maundering; however, I am quite unfit—‘I am for action quite unfit Either of exercise or wit.’  My father is in a variable state; many sorrows and perplexities environ the house of Stevenson; my mother shoots north at this hour on business of a distinctly rancid character; my father (under my wife’s tutorage) proceeds to-morrow to Salisbury; I remain here in my bed and whistle; in no quarter of heaven is anything encouraging apparent, except that the good Colvin comes to the hotel here on a visit.  This dreary view of life is somewhat blackened by the fact that my head aches, which I always regard as a liberty on the part of the powers that be.  This is also my first letter since my recovery.  God speed your laudatory pen!</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR LOW,—The fares to London may be found in any continental Bradshaw or sich; from London to Bournemouth impoverished parties who can stoop to the third class get their ticket for the matter of 10s., or, as my wife loves to phrase it, ‘a half a pound.’  You will also be involved in a 3s. fare to get to Skerryvore; but this, I dare say, friends could help you in on your arrival; so that you may reserve your energies for the two tickets—costing the matter of a pound—and the usual gratuities to porters.  This does not seem to me much: considering the intellectual pleasures that await you here, I call it dirt cheap.  I <hi rend="italic">believe</hi> the third class from Paris to London (<hi rend="italic">viâ</hi> Dover) is <hi rend="italic">about</hi> forty francs, but I cannot swear.  Suppose it to be fifty.</p>

                     <p>MY DEAREST CUMMY,—As usual, I have been a dreary bad fellow and not written for ages; but you must just try to forgive me, to believe (what is the truth) that the number of my letters is no measure of the number of times I think of you, and to remember how much writing I have to do.  The weather is bright, but still cold; and my father, I’m afraid, feels it sharply.  He has had—still has, rather—a most obstinate jaundice, which has reduced him cruelly in strength, and really upset him altogether.  I hope, or think, he is perhaps a little better; but he suffers much, cannot sleep at night, and gives John and my mother a severe life of it to wait upon him.  My wife is, I think, a little better, but no great shakes.  I keep mightily respectable myself.</p>
                     <p>Coolin’s Tombstone is now built into the front wall of Skerryvore, and poor Bogie’s (with a Latin inscription also) is set just above it.  Poor, unhappy wee man, he died, as you must have heard, in fight, which was what he would have chosen; for military glory was more in his line than the domestic virtues.  I believe this is about all my news, except that, as I write, there is a blackbird singing in our garden trees, as it were at Swanston.  I would like fine to go up the burnside a bit, and sit by the pool and be young again—or no, be what I am still, only there instead of here, for just a little.  Did you see that I had written about John Todd?  In this month’s <hi rend="italic">Longman</hi> it was; if you have not seen it, I will try and send it you.  Some day climb as high as Halkerside for me (I am never likely to do it for myself), and sprinkle some of the well water on the turf.  I am afraid it is a pagan rite, but quite harmless, and <hi rend="italic">ye can sain it wi’ a bit prayer</hi>.  Tell the Peewies that I mind their forbears well.  My heart is sometimes heavy, and sometimes glad to mind it all.  But for what we have received, the Lord make us truly thankful.  Don’t forget to sprinkle the water, and do it in my name; I feel a childish eagerness in this.</p>
                     <p>Remember me most kindly to James, and with all sorts of love to yourself, believe me, your laddie,</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR S. C.,—At last I can write a word to you.  Your little note in the <hi rend="italic">P. M. G.</hi> was charming.  I have written four pages in the <hi rend="italic">Contemporary</hi>, which Bunting found room for: they are not very good, but I shall do more for his memory in time.</p>
                     <p>About the death, I have long hesitated, I was long before I could tell my mind; and now I know it, and can but say that I am glad.  If we could have had my father, that would have been a different thing.  But to keep that changeling—suffering changeling—any longer, could better none and nothing.  Now he rests; it is more significant, it is more like himself.  He will begin to return to us in the course of time, as he was and as we loved him.</p>
                     <p>My favourite words in literature, my favourite scene—‘O let him pass,’ Kent and Lear—was played for me here in the first moment of my return.  I believe Shakespeare saw it with his own father.  I had no words; but it was shocking to see.  He died on his feet, you know; was on his feet the last day, knowing nobody—still he would be up.  This was his constant wish; also that he might smoke a pipe on his last day.  The funeral would have pleased him; it was the largest private funeral in man’s memory here.</p>
                     <p>We have no plans, and it is possible we may go home without going through town.  I do not know; I have no views yet whatever; nor can have any at this stage of my cold and my business.—Ever yours,</p>

                     <p>DEAR LAD,—I write to inform you that Mr. Stevenson’s well-known work, <hi rend="italic">Virginibus Puerisque</hi>, is about to be reprinted.  At the same time a second volume called <hi rend="italic">Memories and Portraits</hi> will issue from the roaring loom.  Its interest will be largely autobiographical, Mr. S. having sketched there the lineaments of many departed friends, and dwelt fondly, and with a m’istened eye, upon byegone pleasures.  The two will be issued under the common title of <hi rend="italic">Familiar Essays</hi>; but the volumes will be vended separately to those who are mean enough not to hawk at both.</p>
                     <p>The blood is at last stopped: only yesterday.  I began to think I should not get away.  However, I hope—I hope—remark the word—no boasting—I hope I may luff up a bit now.  Dobell, whom I saw, gave as usual a good account of my lungs, and expressed himself, like his neighbours, hopefully about the trip.  He says, my uncle says, Scott says, Brown says—they all say—You ought not to be in such a state of health; you should recover.  Well, then, I mean to.  My spirits are rising again after three months of black depression: I almost begin to feel as if I should care to live: I would, by God!  And so I believe I shall.—Yours,</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR LOW,—We—my mother, my wife, my stepson, my maidservant, and myself, five souls—leave, if all is well, Aug. 20th, per Wilson line SS. <hi rend="italic">Ludgate Hill</hi>.  Shall probably evade N. Y. at first, cutting straight to a watering-place: Newport, I believe, its name.  Afterwards we shall steal incognito into <hi rend="italic">la bonne villa</hi>, and see no one but you and the Scribners, if it may be so managed.  You must understand I have been very seedy indeed, quite a dead body; and unless the voyage does miracles, I shall have to draw it dam fine.  Alas, ‘The Canoe Speaks’ is now out of date; it will figure in my volume of verses now imminent.  However, I may find some inspiration some day.—Till very soon, yours ever,</p>

                     <p>SIR,—The weather has been hitherto inimitable.  Inimitable is the only word that I can apply to our fellow-voyagers, whom a categorist, possibly premature, has been already led to divide into two classes—the better sort consisting of the baser kind of Bagman, and the worser of undisguised Beasts of the Field.  The berths are excellent, the pasture swallowable, the champagne of H. James (to recur to my favourite adjective) inimitable.  As for the Commodore, he slept awhile in the evening, tossed off a cup of Henry James with his plain meal, walked the deck till eight, among sands and floating lights and buoys and wrecked brigantines, came down (to his regret) a minute too soon to see Margate lit up, turned in about nine, slept, with some interruptions, but on the whole sweetly, until six, and has already walked a mile or so of deck, among a fleet of other steamers waiting for the tide, within view of Havre, and pleasantly entertained by passing fishing-boats, hovering sea-gulls, and Vulgarians pairing on deck with endearments of primitive simplicity.  There, sir, can be viewed the sham quarrel, the sham desire for information, and every device of these two poor ancient sexes (who might, you might think, have learned in the course of the ages something new) down to the exchange of head-gear.—I am, sir, yours,</p>
                     <p>Bold Bob Boltsprit.</p>
                     <p>B. B. B. (<hi rend="italic">alias</hi> the Commodore) will now turn to his proofs.  Havre de Grace is a city of some show.  It is for-ti-fied; and, so far as I can see, is a place of some trade.  It is situ-ated in France, a country of Europe.  You always complain there are no facts in my letters.</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR COLVIN,—So long it went excellent well, and I had a time I am glad to have had; really enjoying my life.  There is nothing like being at sea, after all.  And O, why have I allowed myself to rot so long on land?  But on the Banks I caught a cold, and I have not yet got over it.  My reception here was idiotic to the last degree. . . .  It is very silly, and not pleasant, except where humour enters; and I confess the poor interviewer lads pleased me.  They are too good for their trade; avoided anything I asked them to avoid, and were no more vulgar in their reports than they could help.  I liked the lads.</p>
                     <p>O, it was lovely on our stable-ship, chock full of stallions.  She rolled heartily, rolled some of the fittings out of our state-room, and I think a more dangerous cruise (except that it was summer) it would be hard to imagine.  But we enjoyed it to the masthead, all but Fanny; and even she perhaps a little.  When we got in, we had run out of beer, stout, cocoa, soda-water, water, fresh meat, and (almost) of biscuit.  But it was a thousandfold pleasanter than a great big Birmingham liner like a new hotel; and we liked the officers, and made friends with the quartermasters, and I (at least) made a friend of a baboon (for we carried a cargo of apes), whose embraces have pretty near cost me a coat.  The passengers improved, and were a very good specimen lot, with no drunkard, no gambling that I saw, and less grumbling and backbiting than one would have asked of poor human nature.  Apes, stallions, cows, matches, hay, and poor men-folk, all, or almost all, came successfully to land.—Yours ever,</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR JAMES,—Here we are at Newport in the house of the good Fairchilds; and a sad burthen we have laid upon their shoulders.  I have been in bed practically ever since I came.  I caught a cold on the Banks after having had the finest time conceivable, and enjoyed myself more than I could have hoped on board our strange floating menagerie: stallions and monkeys and matches made our cargo; and the vast continent of these incongruities rolled the while like a haystack; and the stallions stood hypnotised by the motion, looking through the ports at our dinner-table, and winked when the crockery was broken; and the little monkeys stared at each other in their cages, and were thrown overboard like little bluish babies; and the big monkey, Jacko, scoured about the ship and rested willingly in my arms, to the ruin of my clothing; and the man of the stallions made a bower of the black tarpaulin, and sat therein at the feet of a raddled divinity, like a picture on a box of chocolates; and the other passengers, when they were not sick, looked on and laughed.  Take all this picture, and make it roll till the bell shall sound unexpected notes and the fittings shall break lose in our state-room, and you have the voyage of the <hi rend="italic">Ludgate Hill</hi>.  She arrived in the port of New York, without beer, porter, soda-water, curaçoa, fresh meat, or fresh water; and yet we lived, and we regret her.</p>
                     <p>My wife is a good deal run down, and I am no great shakes.</p>
                     <p>America is, as I remarked, a fine place to eat in, and a great place for kindness; but, Lord, what a silly thing is popularity!  I envy the cool obscurity of Skerryvore.  If it even paid, said Meanness! and was abashed at himself.—Yours most sincerely,</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR S. C.,—Your delightful letter has just come, and finds me in a New York hotel, waiting the arrival of a sculptor (St. Gaudens) who is making a medallion of yours truly and who is (to boot) one of the handsomest and nicest fellows I have seen.  I caught a cold on the Banks; fog is not for me; nearly died of interviewers and visitors, during twenty-four hours in New York; cut for Newport with Lloyd and Valentine, a journey like fairy-land for the most engaging beauties, one little rocky and pine-shaded cove after another, each with a house and a boat at anchor, so that I left my heart in each and marvelled why American authors had been so unjust to their country; caught another cold on the train; arrived at Newport to go to bed and to grow worse, and to stay in bed until I left again; the Fairchilds proving during this time kindness itself; Mr. Fairchild simply one of the most engaging men in the world, and one of the children, Blair, <hi rend="italic">aet.</hi> ten, a great joy and amusement in his solemn adoring attitude to the author of <hi rend="italic">Treasure Island</hi>.</p>
                     <p>Here I was interrupted by the arrival of my sculptor.  I have begged him to make a medallion of himself and give me a copy.  I will not take up the sentence in which I was wandering so long, but begin fresh.  I was ten or twelve days at Newport; then came back convalescent to New York.  Fanny and Lloyd are off to the Adirondacks to see if that will suit; and the rest of us leave Monday (this is Saturday) to follow them up.  I hope we may manage to stay there all winter.  I have a splendid appetite and have on the whole recovered well after a mighty sharp attack.  I am now on a salary of £500 a year for twelve articles in <hi rend="italic">Scribner’s Magazine</hi> on what I like; it is more than £500, but I cannot calculate more precisely.  You have no idea how much is made of me here; I was offered £2000 for a weekly article—eh heh! how is that? but I refused that lucrative job.  The success of <hi rend="italic">Underwoods</hi> is gratifying.  You see, the verses are sane; that is their strong point, and it seems it is strong enough to carry them.</p>
                     <p>A thousand thanks for your grand letter, ever yours,</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR LAD,—Herewith verses for Dr. Hake, which please communicate.  I did my best with the interviewers; I don’t know if Lloyd sent you the result; my heart was too sick: you can do nothing with them; and yet—literally sweated with anxiety to please, and took me down in long hand!</p>
                     <p>I have been quite ill, but go better.  I am being not busted, but medallioned, by St. Gaudens, who is a first-rate, plain, high-minded artist and honest fellow; you would like him down to the ground.  I believe sculptors are fine fellows when they are not demons.  O, I am now a salaried person, £600 a year, <ref target="#6855990405419608431_637-h-3.htm.xhtml#footnote66">[66]</ref> to write twelve articles in <hi rend="italic">Scribner’s Magazine</hi>; it remains to be seen if it really pays, huge as the sum is, but the slavery may overweigh me.  I hope you will like my answer to Hake, and specially that he will.</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR BOB,—The cold [of Colorado] was too rigorous for me; I could not risk the long railway voyage, and the season was too late to risk the Eastern, Cape Hatteras side of the steamer one; so here we stuck and stick.  We have a wooden house on a hill-top, overlooking a river, and a village about a quarter of a mile away, and very wooded hills; the whole scene is very Highland, bar want of heather and the wooden houses.</p>
                     <p>I have got one good thing of my sea voyage: it is proved the sea agrees heartily with me, and my mother likes it; so if I get any better, or no worse, my mother will likely hire a yacht for a month or so in summer.  Good Lord!  What fun!  Wealth is only useful for two things: a yacht and a string quartette.  For these two I will sell my soul.  Except for these I hold that £700 a year is as much as anybody can possibly want; and I have had more, so I know, for the extry coins were for no use, excepting for illness, which damns everything.</p>
                     <p>I was so happy on board that ship, I could not have believed it possible.  We had the beastliest weather, and many discomforts; but the mere fact of its being a tramp-ship gave us many comforts; we could cut about with the men and officers, stay in the wheel-house, discuss all manner of things, and really be a little at sea.  And truly there is nothing else.  I had literally forgotten what happiness was, and the full mind—full of external and physical things, not full of cares and labours and rot about a fellow’s behaviour.  My heart literally sang; I truly care for nothing so much as for that.  We took so north a course, that we saw Newfoundland; no one in the ship had ever seen it before.</p>
                     <p>It was beyond belief to me how she rolled; in seemingly smooth water, the bell striking, the fittings bounding out of our state-room.  It is worth having lived these last years, partly because I have written some better books, which is always pleasant, but chiefly to have had the joy of this voyage.  I have been made a lot of here, and it is sometimes pleasant, sometimes the reverse; but I could give it all up, and agree that—was the author of my works, for a good seventy ton schooner and the coins to keep her on.  And to think there are parties with yachts who would make the exchange!  I know a little about fame now; it is no good compared to a yacht; and anyway there is more fame in a yacht, more genuine fame; to cross the Atlantic and come to anchor in Newport (say) with the Union Jack, and go ashore for your letters and hang about the pier, among the holiday yachtsmen—that’s fame, that’s glory, and nobody can take it away; they can’t say your book is bad; you <hi rend="italic">have</hi> crossed the Atlantic.  I should do it south by the West Indies, to avoid the damned Banks; and probably come home by steamer, and leave the skipper to bring the yacht home.</p>
                     <p>Well, if all goes well, we shall maybe sail out of Southampton water some of these days and take a run to Havre, and try the Baltic, or somewhere.</p>
                     <p>Love to you all.—Ever your afft.,</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR GOSSE,—I have just read your article twice, with cheers of approving laughter.  I do not believe you ever wrote anything so funny: Tyndall’s ‘shell,’ the passage on the Davos press and its invaluable issues, and that on V. Hugo and Swinburne, are exquisite; so, I say it more ruefully, is the touch about the doctors.  For the rest, I am very glad you like my verses so well; and the qualities you ascribe to them seem to me well found and well named.  I own to that kind of candour you attribute to me: when I am frankly interested, I suppose I fancy the public will be so too; and when I am moved, I am sure of it.  It has been my luck hitherto to meet with no staggering disillusion.  ‘Before’ and ‘After’ may be two; and yet I believe the habit is now too thoroughly ingrained to be altered.  About the doctors, you were right, that dedication has been the subject of some pleasantries that made me grind, and of your happily touched reproof which made me blush.  And to miscarry in a dedication is an abominable form of book-wreck; I am a good captain, I would rather lose the tent and save my dedication.</p>
                     <p>I am at Saranac Lake in the Adirondacks, I suppose for the winter: it seems a first-rate place; we have a house in the eye of many winds, with a view of a piece of running water—Highland, all but the dear hue of peat—and of many hills—Highland also, but for the lack of heather.  Soon the snow will close on us; we are here some twenty miles—twenty-seven, they say, but this I profoundly disbelieve—in the woods; communication by letter is slow and (let me be consistent) aleatory; by telegram is as near as may be impossible.</p>
                     <p>I had some experience of American appreciation; I liked a little of it, but there is too much; a little of that would go a long way to spoil a man; and I like myself better in the woods.  I am so damned candid and ingenuous (for a cynic), and so much of a ‘cweatu’ of impulse—aw’ (if you remember that admirable Leech), that I begin to shirk any more taffy; I think I begin to like it too well.  But let us trust the Gods; they have a rod in pickle; reverently I doff my trousers, and with screwed eyes await the <hi rend="italic">amari aliquid</hi> of the great God Busby.</p>
                     <p>I thank you for the article in all ways, and remain yours affectionately,</p>

                     <p>We are here (I suppose) for the winter in the Adirondacks, a hill and forest country on the Canadian border of New York State, very unsettled and primitive and cold, and healthful, or we are the more bitterly deceived.  I believe it will do well for me; but must not boast.</p>
                     <p>My wife is away to Indiana to see her family; my mother, Lloyd, and I remain here in the cold, which has been exceeding sharp, and the hill air, which is inimitably fine.  We all eat bravely, and sleep well, and make great fires, and get along like one o’clock.</p>
                     <p>I am now a salaried party; I am a <hi rend="italic">bourgeois</hi> now; I am to write a weekly paper for Scribner’s, at a scale of payment which makes my teeth ache for shame and diffidence.  The editor is, I believe, to apply to you; for we were talking over likely men, and when I instanced you, he said he had had his eye upon you from the first.  It is worth while, perhaps, to get in tow with the Scribners; they are such thorough gentlefolk in all ways that it is always a pleasure to deal with them.  I am like to be a millionaire if this goes on, and be publicly hanged at the social revolution: well, I would prefer that to dying in my bed; and it would be a godsend to my biographer, if ever I have one.  What are you about?  I hope you are all well and in good case and spirits, as I am now, after a most nefast experience of despondency before I left; but indeed I was quite run down.  Remember me to Mrs. Archer, and give my respects to Tom.—Yours very truly,</p>
                     <p>Robert Louis Stevenson.</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR HENRY JAMES,—This is to say <hi rend="italic">First</hi>, the voyage was a huge success.  We all enjoyed it (bar my wife) to the ground: sixteen days at sea with a cargo of hay, matches, stallions, and monkeys, and in a ship with no style on, and plenty of sailors to talk to, and the endless pleasures of the sea—the romance of it, the sport of the scratch dinner and the smashing crockery, the pleasure—an endless pleasure—of balancing to the swell: well, it’s over.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Second</hi>, I had a fine time, rather a troubled one, at Newport and New York; saw much of and liked hugely the Fairchilds, St. Gaudens the sculptor, Gilder of the <hi rend="italic">Century</hi>—just saw the dear Alexander—saw a lot of my old and admirable friend Will Low, whom I wish you knew and appreciated—was medallioned by St. Gaudens, and at last escaped to</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Third</hi>, Saranac Lake, where we now are, and which I believe we mean to like and pass the winter at.  Our house—emphatically ‘Baker’s’—is on a hill, and has a sight of a stream turning a corner in the valley—bless the face of running water!—and sees some hills too, and the paganly prosaic roofs of Saranac itself; the Lake it does not see, nor do I regret that; I like water (fresh water I mean) either running swiftly among stones, or else largely qualified with whisky.  As I write, the sun (which has been long a stranger) shines in at my shoulder; from the next room, the bell of Lloyd’s typewriter makes an agreeable music as it patters off (at a rate which astonishes this experienced novelist) the early chapters of a humorous romance; from still further off—the walls of Baker’s are neither ancient nor massive—rumours of Valentine about the kitchen stove come to my ears; of my mother and Fanny I hear nothing, for the excellent reason that they have gone sparking off, one to Niagara, one to Indianapolis.  People complain that I never give news in my letters.  I have wiped out that reproach.</p>
                     <p>But now, <hi rend="italic">Fourth</hi>, I have seen the article; and it may be from natural partiality, I think it the best you have written.  O—I remember the Gautier, which was an excellent performance; and the Balzac, which was good; and the Daudet, over which I licked my chops; but the R. L. S. is better yet.  It is so humorous, and it hits my little frailties with so neat (and so friendly) a touch; and Alan is the occasion for so much happy talk, and the quarrel is so generously praised.  I read it twice, though it was only some hours in my possession; and Low, who got it for me from the <hi rend="italic">Century</hi>, sat up to finish it ere he returned it; and, sir, we were all delighted.  Here is the paper out, nor will anything, not even friendship, not even gratitude for the article, induce me to begin a second sheet; so here with the kindest remembrances and the warmest good wishes, I remain, yours affectionately,</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR MR. SCRIBNER,—Heaven help me, I am under a curse just now.  I have played fast and loose with what I said to you; and that, I beg you to believe, in the purest innocence of mind.  I told you you should have the power over all my work in this country; and about a fortnight ago, when M’Clure was here, I calmly signed a bargain for the serial publication of a story.  You will scarce believe that I did this in mere oblivion; but I did; and all that I can say is that I will do so no more, and ask you to forgive me.  Please write to me soon as to this.</p>
                     <p>Will you oblige me by paying in for three articles, as already sent, to my account with John Paton &amp; Co., 52 William Street?  This will be most convenient for us.</p>
                     <p>The fourth article is nearly done; and I am the more deceived, or it is <hi rend="italic">A Buster</hi>.</p>
                     <p>Now as to the first thing in this letter, I do wish to hear from you soon; and I am prepared to hear any reproach, or (what is harder to hear) any forgiveness; for I have deserved the worst.—Yours sincerely,</p>

                     <p>DEAR MR. BURLINGAME,—I enclose corrected proof of <hi rend="italic">Beggars</hi>, which seems good.  I mean to make a second sermon, which, if it is about the same length as <hi rend="italic">Pulvis et Umbra</hi>, might go in along with it as two sermons, in which case I should call the first ‘The Whole Creation,’ and the second ‘Any Good.’  We shall see; but you might say how you like the notion.</p>
                     <p>One word: if you have heard from Mr. Scribner of my unhappy oversight in the matter of a story, you will make me ashamed to write to you, and yet I wish to beg you to help me into quieter waters.  The oversight committed—and I do think it was not so bad as Mr. Scribner seems to think it-and discovered, I was in a miserable position.  I need not tell you that my first impulse was to offer to share or to surrender the price agreed upon when it should fall due; and it is almost to my credit that I arranged to refrain.  It is one of these positions from which there is no escape; I cannot undo what I have done.  And I wish to beg you—should Mr. Scribner speak to you in the matter—to try to get him to see this neglect of mine for no worse than it is: unpardonable enough, because a breach of an agreement; but still pardonable, because a piece of sheer carelessness and want of memory, done, God knows, without design and since most sincerely regretted.  I have no memory.  You have seen how I omitted to reserve the American rights in <hi rend="italic">Jekyll</hi>: last winter I wrote and demanded, as an increase, a less sum than had already been agreed upon for a story that I gave to Cassell’s.  For once that my forgetfulness has, by a cursed fortune, seemed to gain, instead of lose, me money, it is painful indeed that I should produce so poor an impression on the mind of Mr. Scribner.  But I beg you to believe, and if possible to make him believe, that I am in no degree or sense a <hi rend="italic">faiseur</hi>, and that in matters of business my design, at least, is honest.  Nor (bating bad memory and self-deception) am I untruthful in such affairs.</p>
                     <p>If Mr. Scribner shall have said nothing to you in the matter, please regard the above as unwritten, and believe me, yours very truly,</p>

                     <p>DEAR MR. BURLINGAME,—The revise seemed all right, so I did not trouble you with it; indeed, my demand for one was theatrical, to impress that obdurate dog, your reader.  Herewith a third paper: it has been a cruel long time upon the road, but here it is, and not bad at last, I fondly hope.  I was glad you liked the <hi rend="italic">Lantern Bearers</hi>; I did, too.  I thought it was a good paper, really contained some excellent sense, and was ingeniously put together.  I have not often had more trouble than I have with these papers; thirty or forty pages of foul copy, twenty is the very least I have had.  Well, you pay high; it is fit that I should have to work hard, it somewhat quiets my conscience.—Yours very truly,</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR SYMONDS,—I think we have both meant and wanted to write to you any time these months; but we have been much tossed about, among new faces and old, and new scenes and old, and scenes (like this of Saranac) which are neither one nor other.  To give you some clue to our affairs, I had best begin pretty well back.  We sailed from the Thames in a vast bucket of iron that took seventeen days from shore to shore.  I cannot describe how I enjoyed the voyage, nor what good it did me; but on the Banks I caught friend catarrh.  In New York and then in Newport I was pretty ill; but on my return to New York, lying in bed most of the time, with St. Gaudens the sculptor sculping me, and my old friend Low around, I began to pick up once more.  Now here we are in a kind of wilderness of hills and firwoods and boulders and snow and wooden houses.  So far as we have gone the climate is grey and harsh, but hungry and somnolent; and although not charming like that of Davos, essentially bracing and briskening.  The country is a kind of insane mixture of Scotland and a touch of Switzerland and a dash of America, and a thought of the British Channel in the skies.  We have a decent house—</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">December</hi> 6<hi rend="italic">th</hi>.</p>
                     <p>—A decent house, as I was saying, sir, on a hill-top, with a look down a Scottish river in front, and on one hand a Perthshire hill; on the other, the beginnings and skirts of the village play hide and seek among other hills.  We have been below zero, I know not how far (10 at 8 A.M. once), and when it is cold it is delightful; but hitherto the cold has not held, and we have chopped in and out from frost to thaw, from snow to rain, from quiet air to the most disastrous north-westerly curdlers of the blood.  After a week of practical thaw, the ice still bears in favoured places.  So there is hope.</p>
                     <p>I wonder if you saw my book of verses?  It went into a second edition, because of my name, I suppose, and its <hi rend="italic">prose</hi> merits.  I do not set up to be a poet.  Only an all-round literary man: a man who talks, not one who sings.  But I believe the very fact that it was only speech served the book with the public.  Horace is much a speaker, and see how popular! most of Martial is only speech, and I cannot conceive a person who does not love his Martial; most of Burns, also, such as ‘The Louse,’ ‘The Toothache,’ ‘The Haggis,’ and lots more of his best.  Excuse this little apology for my house; but I don’t like to come before people who have a note of song, and let it be supposed I do not know the difference.</p>
                     <p>To return to the more important—news.  My wife again suffers in high and cold places; I again profit.  She is off to-day to New York for a change, as heretofore to Berne, but I am glad to say in better case than then.  Still it is undeniable she suffers, and you must excuse her (at least) if we both prove bad correspondents.  I am decidedly better, but I have been terribly cut up with business complications: one disagreeable, as threatening loss; one, of the most intolerable complexion, as involving me in dishonour.  The burthen of consistent carelessness: I have lost much by it in the past; and for once (to my damnation) I have gained.  I am sure you will sympathise.  It is hard work to sleep; it is hard to be told you are a liar, and have to hold your peace, and think, ‘Yes, by God, and a thief too!’  You remember my lectures on Ajax, or the Unintentional Sin?  Well, I know all about that now.  Nothing seems so unjust to the sufferer: or is more just in essence.  <hi rend="italic">Laissez passer la justice de Dieu</hi>.</p>
                     <p>Lloyd has learned to use the typewriter, and has most gallantly completed upon that the draft of a tale, which seems to me not without merit and promise, it is so silly, so gay, so absurd, in spots (to my partial eyes) so genuinely humorous.  It is true, he would not have written it but for the New Arabian Nights; but it is strange to find a young writer funny.  Heavens, but I was depressing when I took the pen in hand!  And now I doubt if I am sadder than my neighbours.  Will this beginner move in the inverse direction?</p>
                     <p>Let me have your news, and believe me, my dear Symonds, with genuine affection, yours,</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR LAD,—I was indeed overjoyed to hear of the Dumas.  In the matter of the dedication, are not cross dedications a little awkward?  Lang and Rider Haggard did it, to be sure.  Perpend.  And if you should conclude against a dedication, there is a passage in <hi rend="italic">Memories and Portraits</hi> written <hi rend="italic">at</hi> you, when I was most desperate (to stir you up a bit), which might be quoted: something about Dumas still waiting his biographer.  I have a decent time when the weather is fine; when it is grey, or windy, or wet (as it too often is), I am merely degraded to the dirt.  I get some work done every day with a devil of a heave; not extra good ever; and I regret my engagement.  Whiles I have had the most deplorable business annoyances too; have been threatened with having to refund money; got over that; and found myself in the worse scrape of being a kind of unintentional swindler.  These have worried me a great deal; also old age with his stealing steps seems to have clawed me in his clutch to some tune.</p>
                     <p>Do you play All Fours?  We are trying it; it is still all haze to me.  Can the elder hand <hi rend="italic">beg</hi> more than once?  The Port Admiral is at Boston mingling with millionaires.  I am but a weed on Lethe wharf.  The wife is only so-so.  The Lord lead us all: if I can only get off the stage with clean hands, I shall sing Hosanna.  ‘Put’ is described quite differently from your version in a book I have; what are your rules?  The Port Admiral is using a game of put in a tale of his, the first copy of which was gloriously finished about a fortnight ago, and the revise gallantly begun: <hi rend="italic">The Finsbury Tontine</hi> it is named, and might fill two volumes, and is quite incredibly silly, and in parts (it seems to me) pretty humorous.—Love to all from</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR MRS. JENKIN,—The Opal is very well; it is fed with glycerine when it seems hungry.  I am very well, and get about much more than I could have hoped.  My wife is not very well; there is no doubt the high level does not agree with her, and she is on the move for a holiday to New York.  Lloyd is at Boston on a visit, and I hope has a good time.  My mother is really first-rate; she and I, despairing of other games for two, now play All Fours out of a gamebook, and have not yet discovered its niceties, if any.</p>
                     <p>You will have heard, I dare say, that they made a great row over me here.  They also offered me much money, a great deal more than my works are worth: I took some of it, and was greedy and hasty, and am now very sorry.  I have done with big prices from now out.  Wealth and self-respect seem, in my case, to be strangers.</p>
                     <p>We were talking the other day of how well Fleeming managed to grow rich.  Ah, that is a rare art; something more intellectual than a virtue.  The book has not yet made its appearance here; the life alone, with a little preface, is to appear in the States; and the Scribners are to send you half the royalties.  I should like it to do well, for Fleeming’s sake.</p>
                     <p>Will you please send me the Greek water-carrier’s song?  I have a particular use for it.</p>
                     <p>Have I any more news, I wonder?—and echo wonders along with me.  I am strangely disquieted on all political matters; and I do not know if it is ‘the signs of the times’ or the sign of my own time of life.  But to me the sky seems black both in France and England, and only partly clear in America.  I have not seen it so dark in my time; of that I am sure.</p>
                     <p>Please let us have some news; and, excuse me, for the sake of my well-known idleness; and pardon Fanny, who is really not very well, for this long silence.—Very sincerely your friend,</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR MISS BOODLE,—I am so much afraid, our gamekeeper may weary of unacknowledged reports!  Hence, in the midst of a perfect horror of detestable weathers of a quite incongruous strain, and with less desire for correspondence than—well, than—well, with no desire for correspondence, behold me dash into the breach.  Do keep up your letters.  They are most delightful to this exiled backwoods family; and in your next, we shall hope somehow or other to hear better news of you and yours—that in the first place—and to hear more news of our beasts and birds and kindly fruits of earth and those human tenants who are (truly) too much with us.</p>
                     <p>I am very well; better than for years: that is for good.  But then my wife is no great shakes; the place does not suit her—it is my private opinion that no place does—and she is now away down to New York for a change, which (as Lloyd is in Boston) leaves my mother and me and Valentine alone in our wind-beleaguered hilltop hatbox of a house.  You should hear the cows butt against the walls in the early morning while they feed; you should also see our back log when the thermometer goes (as it does go) away—away below zero, till it can be seen no more by the eye of man—not the thermometer, which is still perfectly visible, but the mercury, which curls up into the bulb like a hibernating bear; you should also see the lad who ‘does chores’ for us, with his red stockings and his thirteen year old face, and his highly manly tramp into the room; and his two alternative answers to all questions about the weather: either ‘Cold,’ or with a really lyrical movement of the voice, ‘<hi rend="italic">Lovely</hi>—raining!’</p>
                     <p>Will you take this miserable scarp for what it is worth?  Will you also understand that I am the man to blame, and my wife is really almost too much out of health to write, or at least doesn’t write?—And believe me, with kind remembrance to Mrs. Boodle and your sisters, very sincerely yours,</p>

                     <p>I beg of you also to consider my strange position.  I jined a club which it was said was to defend the Union; and had a letter from the secretary, which his name I believe was Lord Warmingpan (or words to that effect), to say I am elected, and had better pay up a certain sum of money, I forget what.  Now I cannae verra weel draw a blank cheque and send to—</p>
                     <p>Lord Warmingpan (or words to that effect),<lb/>London, England.</p>
                     <p>And, man, if it was possible, I would be dooms glad to be out o’ this bit scrapie.  Mebbe the club was ca’d ‘The Union,’ but I wouldnae like to sweir; and mebbe it wasnae, or mebbe only words to that effec’—but I wouldnae care just exac’ly about sweirin’.  Do ye no think Henley, or Pollick, or some o’ they London fellies, micht mebbe perhaps find out for me? and just what the soom was?  And that you would aiblins pay for me?  For I thocht I was sae dam patriotic jinin’, and it would be a kind o’ a come-doun to be turned out again.  Mebbe Lang would ken; or mebbe Rider Haggyard: they’re kind o’ Union folks.  But it’s my belief his name was Warmingpan whatever. Yours,</p>

                     <p>DEAR MISS MONROE,—Many thanks for your letter and your good wishes.  It was much my desire to get to Chicago: had I done—or if I yet do—so, I shall hope to see the original of my photograph, which is one of my show possessions; but the fates are rather contrary.  My wife is far from well; I myself dread worse than almost any other imaginable peril, that miraculous and really insane invention the American Railroad Car.  Heaven help the man—may I add the woman—that sets foot in one!  Ah, if it were only an ocean to cross, it would be a matter of small thought to me—and great pleasure.  But the railroad car—every man has his weak point; and I fear the railroad car as abjectly as I do an earwig, and, on the whole, on better grounds.  You do not know how bitter it is to have to make such a confession; for you have not the pretension nor the weakness of a man.  If I do get to Chicago, you will hear of me: so much can be said.  And do you never come east?</p>
                     <p>I was pleased to recognise a word of my poor old Deacon in your letter.  It would interest me very much to hear how it went and what you thought of piece and actors; and my collaborator, who knows and respects the photograph, would be pleased too.—Still in the hope of seeing you, I am, yours very truly,</p>
                     <p>Robert Louis Stevenson.</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR HENRY JAMES,—It may please you to know how our family has been employed.  In the silence of the snow the afternoon lamp has lighted an eager fireside group: my mother reading, Fanny, Lloyd, and I devoted listeners; and the work was really one of the best works I ever heard; and its author is to be praised and honoured; and what do you suppose is the name of it? and have you ever read it yourself? and (I am bound I will get to the bottom of the page before I blow the gaff, if I have to fight it out on this line all summer; for if you have not to turn a leaf, there can be no suspense, the conspectory eye being swift to pick out proper names; and without suspense, there can be little pleasure in this world, to my mind at least)—and, in short, the name of it is <hi rend="italic">Roderick Hudson</hi>, if you please.  My dear James, it is very spirited, and very sound, and very noble too.  Hudson, Mrs. Hudson, Rowland, O, all first-rate: Rowland a very fine fellow; Hudson as good as he can stick (did you know Hudson?  I suspect you did), Mrs. H. his real born mother, a thing rarely managed in fiction.</p>
                     <p>We are all keeping pretty fit and pretty hearty; but this letter is not from me to you, it is from a reader of <hi rend="italic">R. H.</hi> to the author of the same, and it says nothing, and has nothing to say, but thank you.</p>
                     <p>We are going to re-read <hi rend="italic">Casamassima</hi> as a proper pendant.  Sir, I think these two are your best, and care not who knows it.</p>
                     <p>May I beg you, the next time <hi rend="italic">Roderick</hi> is printed off, to go over the sheets of the last few chapters, and strike out ‘immense’ and ‘tremendous’?  You have simply dropped them there like your pocket-handkerchief; all you have to do is to pick them up and pouch them, and your room—what do I say?—your cathedral!—will be swept and garnished.—I am, dear sir, your delighted reader,</p>
                     <p>Robert Louis Stevenson.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">P.S.</hi>—Perhaps it is a pang of causeless honesty, perhaps.  I hope it will set a value on my praise of <hi rend="italic">Roderick</hi>, perhaps it’s a burst of the diabolic, but I must break out with the news that I can’t bear the <hi rend="italic">Portrait of a Lady</hi>.  I read it all, and I wept too; but I can’t stand your having written it; and I beg you will write no more of the like.  <hi rend="italic">Infra</hi>, sir; Below you: I can’t help it—it may be your favourite work, but in my eyes it’s BELOW YOU to write and me to read.  I thought <hi rend="italic">Roderick</hi> was going to be another such at the beginning; and I cannot describe my pleasure as I found it taking bones and blood, and looking out at me with a moved and human countenance, whose lineaments are written in my memory until my last of days.</p>
                     <p>R. L. S.</p>
                     <p>My wife begs your forgiveness; I believe for her silence.</p>

                     <head>to Sidney Colvin</head>
                     <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Saranac Lake</hi> [<hi rend="italic">December</hi> 1887].</p>
                     <p>MY DEAR COLVIN,—This goes to say that we are all fit, and the place is very bleak and wintry, and up to now has shown no such charms of climate as Davos, but is a place where men eat and where the cattarh, catarrh (cattarrh, or cattarrhh) appears to be unknown.  I walk in my verandy in the snaw, sir, looking down over one of those dabbled wintry landscapes that are (to be frank) so chilly to the human bosom, and up at a grey, English—nay, <hi rend="italic">mehercle</hi>, Scottish—heaven; and I think it pretty bleak; and the wind swoops at me round the corner, like a lion, and fluffs the snow in my face; and I could aspire to be elsewhere; but yet I do not catch cold, and yet, when I come in, I eat.  So that hitherto Saranac, if not deliriously delectable, has not been a failure; nay, from the mere point of view of the wicked body, it has proved a success.  But I wish I could still get to the woods; alas, <hi rend="italic">nous n’irons plus au bois</hi> is my poor song; the paths are buried, the dingles drifted full, a little walk is grown a long one; till spring comes, I fear the burthen will hold good.</p>
                     <p>I get along with my papers for <hi rend="italic">Scribner</hi> not fast, nor so far specially well; only this last, the fourth one (which makes a third part of my whole task), I do believe is pulled off after a fashion.  It is a mere sermon: ‘Smith opens out’; <ref target="#6855990405419608431_637-h-3.htm.xhtml#footnote86">[86]</ref> but it is true, and I find it touching and beneficial, to me at least; and I think there is some fine writing in it, some very apt and pregnant phrases.  <hi rend="italic">Pulvis et Umbra</hi>, I call it; I might have called it a Darwinian Sermon, if I had wanted.  Its sentiments, although parsonic, will not offend even you, I believe.  The other three papers, I fear, bear many traces of effort, and the ungenuine inspiration of an income at so much per essay, and the honest desire of the incomer to give good measure for his money.  Well, I did my damndest anyway.</p>
                     <p>We have been reading H. James’s <hi rend="italic">Roderick Hudson</hi>, which I eagerly press you to get at once: it is a book of a high order—the last volume in particular.  I wish Meredith would read it.  It took my breath away.</p>
                     <p>I am at the seventh book of the <hi rend="italic">Æneid</hi>, and quite amazed at its merits (also very often floored by its difficulties).  The Circe passage at the beginning, and the sublime business of Amata with the simile of the boy’s top—O Lord, what a happy thought!—have specially delighted me.—I am, dear sir, your respected friend,</p>
                     <p>John Gregg Gillson, J.P., M.R.I.A., etc.</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR COLVIN,—Thank you for your explanations.  I have done no more Virgil since I finished the seventh book, for I have, first been eaten up with Taine, and next have fallen head over heels into a new tale, <hi rend="italic">The Master of Ballantrae</hi>.  No thought have I now apart from it, and I have got along up to page ninety-two of the draft with great interest.  It is to me a most seizing tale: there are some fantastic elements; the most is a dead genuine human problem—human tragedy, I should say rather.  It will be about as long, I imagine, as <hi rend="italic">Kidnapped</hi>.</p>
                     <p>DRAMATIS PERSONAE:</p>
                     <p>(1) My old Lord Durrisdeer.</p>
                     <p>(2) The Master of Ballantrae, <hi rend="italic">and</hi>
                     </p>
                     <p>(3) Henry Durie, <hi rend="italic">his sons</hi>.</p>
                     <p>(4) Clementina, <hi rend="italic">engaged to the first</hi>, <hi rend="italic">married to the second</hi>.</p>
                     <p>(5) Ephraim Mackellar, <hi rend="italic">land steward at Durrisdeer and narrator of the most of the book</hi>.</p>
                     <p>(6) Francis Burke, Chevalier de St. Louis, <hi rend="italic">one of Prince Charlie’s Irishmen and narrator of the rest</hi>.</p>
                     <p>Besides these, many instant figures, most of them dumb or nearly so: Jessie Brown the whore, Captain Crail, Captain MacCombie, our old friend Alan Breck, our old friend Riach (both only for an instant), Teach the pirate (vulgarly Blackbeard), John Paul and Macconochie, servants at Durrisdeer.  The date is from 1745 to ’65 (about).  The scene, near Kirkcudbright, in the States, and for a little moment in the French East Indies.  I have done most of the big work, the quarrel, duel between the brothers, and announcement of the death to Clementina and my Lord—Clementina, Henry, and Mackellar (nicknamed Squaretoes) are really very fine fellows; the Master is all I know of the devil.  I have known hints of him, in the world, but always cowards; he is as bold as a lion, but with the same deadly, causeless duplicity I have watched with so much surprise in my two cowards.  ’Tis true, I saw a hint of the same nature in another man who was not a coward; but he had other things to attend to; the Master has nothing else but his devilry.  Here come my visitors—and have now gone, or the first relay of them; and I hope no more may come.  For mark you, sir, this is our ‘day’—Saturday, as ever was, and here we sit, my mother and I, before a large wood fire and await the enemy with the most steadfast courage; and without snow and greyness: and the woman Fanny in New York for her health, which is far from good; and the lad Lloyd at the inn in the village because he has a cold; and the handmaid Valentine abroad in a sleigh upon her messages; and to-morrow Christmas and no mistake.  Such is human life: <hi rend="italic">la carrière humaine</hi>.  I will enclose, if I remember, the required autograph.</p>
                     <p>I will do better, put it on the back of this page.  Love to all, and mostly, my very dear Colvin, to yourself.  For whatever I say or do, or don’t say or do, you may be very sure I am,—Yours always affectionately,</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR MISS BOODLE,—And a very good Christmas to you all; and better fortune; and if worse, the more courage to support it—which I think is the kinder wish in all human affairs.  Somewhile—I fear a good while—after this, you should receive our Christmas gift; we have no tact and no taste, only a welcome and (often) tonic brutality; and I dare say the present, even after my friend Baxter has acted on and reviewed my hints, may prove a White Elephant.  That is why I dread presents.  And therefore pray understand if any element of that hamper prove unwelcome, <hi rend="italic">it is to be exchanged</hi>.  I will not sit down under the name of a giver of White Elephants.  I never had any elephant but one, and his initials were R. L. S.; and he trod on my foot at a very early age.  But this is a fable, and not in the least to the point: which is that if, for once in my life, I have wished to make things nicer for anybody but the Elephant (see fable), do not suffer me to have made them ineffably more embarrassing, and exchange—ruthlessly exchange!</p>
                     <p>For my part, I am the most cockered up of any mortal being; and one of the healthiest, or thereabout, at some modest distance from the bull’s eye.  I am condemned to write twelve articles in <hi rend="italic">Scribner’s Magazine</hi> for the love of gain; I think I had better send you them; what is far more to the purpose, I am on the jump with a new story which has bewitched me—I doubt it may bewitch no one else.  It is called <hi rend="italic">The Master of Ballantrae</hi>—pronounce Bällän-tray.  If it is not good, well, mine will be the fault; for I believe it is a good tale.</p>
                     <p>The greetings of the season to you, and your mother, and your sisters.  My wife heartily joins.—And I am, yours very sincerely,</p>

                     <p>DEAR CHARLES,—You are the flower of Doers. . . . Will my doer collaborate thus much in my new novel?  In the year 1794 or 5, Mr. Ephraim Mackellar, A.M., late steward on the Durrisdeer estates, completed a set of memoranda (as long as a novel) with regard to the death of the (then) late Lord Durrisdeer, and as to that of his attainted elder brother, called by the family courtesy title the Master of Ballantrae.  These he placed in the hands of John Macbrair.  W.S., the family agent, on the understanding they were to be sealed until 1862, when a century would have elapsed since the affair in the wilderness (my lord’s death).  You succeeded Mr. Macbrair’s firm; the Durrisdeers are extinct; and last year, in an old green box, you found these papers with Macbrair’s indorsation.  It is that indorsation of which I want a copy; you may remember, when you gave me the papers, I neglected to take that, and I am sure you are a man too careful of antiquities to have let it fall aside.  I shall have a little introduction descriptive of my visit to Edinburgh, arrival there, denner with yoursel’, and first reading of the papers in your smoking-room: all of which, of course, you well remember.—Ever yours affectionately,</p>
                     <p>R. L S.</p>
                     <p>Your name is my friend Mr. Johnstone Thomson, W.S.!!!</p>

                     <p>DEAR MR. BURLINGAME,—I am keeping the sermon to see if I can’t add another.  Meanwhile, I will send you very soon a different paper which may take its place.  Possibly some of these days soon I may get together a talk on things current, which should go in (if possible) earlier than either.  I am now less nervous about these papers; I believe I can do the trick without great strain, though the terror that breathed on my back in the beginning is not yet forgotten.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">The Master of Ballantrae</hi> I have had to leave aside, as I was quite worked out.  But in about a week I hope to try back and send you the first four numbers: these are all drafted, it is only the revision that has broken me down, as it is often the hardest work.  These four I propose you should set up for me at once, and we’ll copyright ’em in a pamphlet.  I will tell you the names of the <hi rend="italic">bona fide</hi> purchasers in England.</p>
                     <p>The numbers will run from twenty to thirty pages of my manuscript.  You can give me that much, can you not?  It is a howling good tale—at least these first four numbers are; the end is a trifle more fantastic, but ’tis all picturesque.</p>
                     <p>Don’t trouble about any more French books; I am on another scent, you see, just now.  Only the <hi rend="italic">French in Hindustan</hi> I await with impatience, as that is for <hi rend="italic">Ballantrae</hi>.  The scene of that romance is Scotland—the States—Scotland—India—Scotland—and the States again; so it jumps like a flea.  I have enough about the States now, and very much obliged I am; yet if Drake’s <hi rend="italic">Tragedies of the Wilderness</hi> is (as I gather) a collection of originals, I should like to purchase it.  If it is a picturesque vulgarisation, I do not wish to look it in the face.  Purchase, I say; for I think it would be well to have some such collection by me with a view to fresh works.—Yours very sincerely,</p>
                     <p>Robert Louis Stevenson.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">P.S.</hi>—If you think of having the <hi rend="italic">Master</hi> illustrated, I suggest that Hole would be very well up to the Scottish, which is the larger part.  If you have it done here, tell your artist to look at the hall of Craigievar in Billing’s <hi rend="italic">Baronial and Ecclesiastical Antiquities</hi>, and he will get a broad hint for the hall at Durrisdeer: it is, I think, the chimney of Craigievar and the roof of Pinkie, and perhaps a little more of Pinkie altogether; but I should have to see the book myself to be sure.  Hole would be invaluable for this.  I dare say if you had it illustrated, you could let me have one or two for the English edition.</p>

                     <p>[<hi rend="italic">Saranac</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Winter</hi> 1887–8.]</p>
                     <p>MY DEAR ARCHER,—What am I to say?  I have read your friend’s book with singular relish.  If he has written any other, I beg you will let me see it; and if he has not, I beg him to lose no time in supplying the deficiency.  It is full of promise; but I should like to know his age.  There are things in it that are very clever, to which I attach small importance; it is the shape of the age.  And there are passages, particularly the rally in presence of the Zulu king, that show genuine and remarkable narrative talent—a talent that few will have the wit to understand, a talent of strength, spirit, capacity, sufficient vision, and sufficient self-sacrifice, which last is the chief point in a narrator.</p>
                     <p>As a whole, it is (of course) a fever dream of the most feverish.  Over Bashville the footman I howled with derision and delight; I dote on Bashville—I could read of him for ever; <hi rend="italic">de Bashville je suis le fervent</hi>—there is only one Bashville, and I am his devoted slave; <hi rend="italic">Bashville est magnifique</hi>, <hi rend="italic">mais il n’est guère possible</hi>.  He is the note of the book.  It is all mad, mad and deliriously delightful; the author has a taste in chivalry like Walter Scott’s or Dumas’, and then he daubs in little bits of socialism; he soars away on the wings of the romantic griffon—even the griffon, as he cleaves air, shouting with laughter at the nature of the quest—and I believe in his heart he thinks he is labouring in a quarry of solid granite realism.</p>
                     <p>It is this that makes me—the most hardened adviser now extant—stand back and hold my peace.  If Mr. Shaw is below five-and-twenty, let him go his path; if he is thirty, he had best be told that he is a romantic, and pursue romance with his eyes open;—or perhaps he knows it;—God knows!—my brain is softened.</p>
                     <p>It is HORRID FUN.  All I ask is more of it.  Thank you for the pleasure you gave us, and tell me more of the inimitable author.</p>
                     <p>(I say, Archer, my God, what women!)—Yours very truly,</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR ARCHER,—Pretty sick in bed; but necessary to protest and continue your education.</p>
                     <p>Why was Jenkin an amateur in my eyes?  You think because not amusing (I think he often was amusing).  The reason is this: I never, or almost never, saw two pages of his work that I could not have put in one without the smallest loss of material.  That is the only test I know of writing.  If there is anywhere a thing said in two sentences that could have been as clearly and as engagingly and as forcibly said in one, then it’s amateur work.  Then you will bring me up with old Dumas.  Nay, the object of a story is to be long, to fill up hours; the story-teller’s art of writing is to water out by continual invention, historical and technical, and yet not seem to water; seem on the other hand to practise that same wit of conspicuous and declaratory condensation which is the proper art of writing.  That is one thing in which my stories fail: I am always cutting the flesh off their bones.</p>
                     <p>I would rise from the dead to preach!</p>
                     <p>Hope all well.  I think my wife better, but she’s not allowed to write; and this (only wrung from me by desire to Boss and Parsonise and Dominate, strong in sickness) is my first letter for days, and will likely be my last for many more.  Not blame my wife for her silence: doctor’s orders.  All much interested by your last, and fragment from brother, and anecdotes of Tomarcher.—The sick but still Moral</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR ARCHER,—It happened thus.  I came forth from that performance in a breathing heat of indignation.  (Mind, at this distance of time and with my increased knowledge, I admit there is a problem in the piece; but I saw none then, except a problem in brutality; and I still consider the problem in that case not established.)  On my way down the <hi rend="italic">Français</hi> stairs, I trod on an old gentleman’s toes, whereupon with that suavity that so well becomes me, I turned about to apologise, and on the instant, repenting me of that intention, stopped the apology midway, and added something in French to this effect: No, you are one of the <hi rend="italic">lâches</hi> who have been applauding that piece.  I retract my apology.  Said the old Frenchman, laying his hand on my arm, and with a smile that was truly heavenly in temperance, irony, good-nature, and knowledge of the world, ‘Ah, monsieur, vous êtes bien jeune!’—Yours very truly,</p>

                     <p>DEAR MR. BURLINGAME,—Will you send me (from the library) some of the works of my dear old G. P. R.

                     <p>This sudden return to an ancient favourite hangs upon an accident.  The ‘Franklin County Library’ contains two works of his, <hi rend="italic">The Cavalier</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Morley Ernstein</hi>.  I read the first with indescribable amusement—it was worse than I had feared, and yet somehow engaging; the second (to my surprise) was better than I had dared to hope: a good honest, dull, interesting tale, with a genuine old-fashioned talent in the invention when not strained; and a genuine old-fashioned feeling for the English language.  This experience awoke appetite, and you see I have taken steps to stay it.</p>

                     <p>DEAR MR.

                     <p>2.  I want to say a word as to the <hi rend="italic">Master</hi>.  (<hi rend="italic">The Master of Ballantrae</hi> shall be the name by all means.)  If you like and want it, I leave it to you to make an offer.  You may remember I thought the offer you made when I was still in England too small; by which I did not at all mean, I thought it less than it was worth, but too little to tempt me to undergo the disagreeables of serial publication.  This tale (if you want it) you are to have; for it is the least I can do for you; and you are to observe that the sum you pay me for my articles going far to meet my wants, I am quite open to be satisfied with less than formerly.  I tell you I do dislike this battle of the dollars.  I feel sure you all pay too much here in America; and I beg you not to spoil me any more.  For I am getting spoiled: I do not want wealth, and I feel these big sums demoralise me.</p>
                     <p>My wife came here pretty ill; she had a dreadful bad night; to-day she is better.  But now Valentine is ill; and Lloyd and I have got breakfast, and my hand somewhat shakes after washing dishes.—Yours very sincerely,</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR COLVIN,—Fanny has been very unwell.  She is not long home, has been ill again since her return, but is now better again to a degree.  You must not blame her for not writing, as she is not allowed to write at all, not even a letter.  To add to our misfortunes, Valentine is quite ill and in bed.  Lloyd and I get breakfast; I have now, 10.15, just got the dishes washed and the kitchen all clear, and sit down to give you as much news as I have spirit for, after such an engagement.  Glass is a thing that really breaks my spirit: I do not like to fail, and with glass I cannot reach the work of my high calling—the artist’s.</p>
                     <p>I am, as you may gather from this, wonderfully better: this harsh, grey, glum, doleful climate has done me good.  You cannot fancy how sad a climate it is.  When the thermometer stays all day below 10°, it is really cold; and when the wind blows, O commend me to the result.  Pleasure in life is all delete; there is no red spot left, fires do not radiate, you burn your hands all the time on what seem to be cold stones.  It is odd, zero is like summer heat to us now; and we like, when the thermometer outside is really low, a room at about 48°: 60° we find oppressive.  Yet the natives keep their holes at 90° or even 100°.</p>
                     <p>This was interrupted days ago by household labours.  Since then I have had and (I tremble to write it, but it does seem as if I had) beaten off an influenza.  The cold is exquisite.  Valentine still in bed.  The proofs of the first part of the <hi rend="italic">Master of Ballantrae</hi> begin to come in; soon you shall have it in the pamphlet form; and I hope you will like it.  The second part will not be near so good; but there—we can but do as it’ll do with us.  I have every reason to believe this winter has done me real good, so far as it has gone; and if I carry out my scheme for next winter, and succeeding years, I should end by being a tower of strength.  I want you to save a good holiday for next winter; I hope we shall be able to help you to some larks.  Is there any Greek Isle you would like to explore? or any creek in Asia Minor?—Yours ever affectionately,</p>

CHARTERIS,—I have asked Douglas and Foulis to send you my last volume, so that you may possess my little paper on my father in a permanent shape; not for what that is worth, but as a tribute of respect to one whom my father regarded with such love, esteem, and affection.  Besides, as you will see, I have brought you under contribution, and I have still to thank you for your letter to my mother; so more than kind; in much, so just.  It is my hope, when time and health permit, to do something more definite for my father’s memory.  You are one of the very few who can (if you will) help me.  Pray believe that I lay on you no obligation; I know too well, you may believe me, how difficult it is to put even two sincere lines upon paper, where all, too, is to order.  But if the spirit should ever move you, and you should recall something memorable of your friend, his son will heartily thank you for a note of it.—With much respect, believe me, yours sincerely,</p>
                     <p>Robert Louis Stevenson.</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR DELIGHTFUL JAMES,—To quote your heading to my wife, I think no man writes so elegant a letter, I am sure none so kind, unless it be Colvin, and there is more of the stern parent about him.  I was vexed at your account of my admired Meredith: I wish I could go and see him; as it is I will try to write.  I read with indescribable admiration your <hi rend="italic">Emerson</hi>.  I begin to long for the day when these portraits of yours shall be collected: do put me in.  But Emerson is a higher flight.  Have you a <hi rend="italic">Tourgueneff</hi>?  You have told me many interesting things of him, and I seem to see them written, and forming a graceful and <hi rend="italic">bildend</hi> sketch.  My novel is a tragedy; four parts out of six or seven are written, and gone to Burlingame.  Five parts of it are sound, human tragedy; the last one or two, I regret to say, not so soundly designed; I almost hesitate to write them; they are very picturesque, but they are fantastic; they shame, perhaps degrade, the beginning.  I wish I knew; that was how the tale came to me however.  I got the situation; it was an old taste of mine: The older brother goes out in the ’45, the younger stays; the younger, of course, gets title and estate and marries the bride designate of the elder—a family match, but he (the younger) had always loved her, and she had really loved the elder.  Do you see the situation?  Then the devil and Saranac suggested this <hi rend="italic">dénouement</hi>, and I joined the two ends in a day or two of constant feverish thought, and began to write.  And now—I wonder if I have not gone too far with the fantastic?  The elder brother is an INCUBUS: supposed to be killed at Culloden, he turns up again and bleeds the family of money; on that stopping he comes and lives with them, whence flows the real tragedy, the nocturnal duel of the brothers (very naturally, and indeed, I think, inevitably arising), and second supposed death of the elder.  Husband and wife now really make up, and then the cloven hoof appears.  For the third supposed death and the manner of the third reappearance is steep; steep, sir.  It is even very steep, and I fear it shames the honest stuff so far; but then it is highly pictorial, and it leads up to the death of the elder brother at the hands of the younger in a perfectly cold-blooded murder, of which I wish (and mean) the reader to approve.  You see how daring is the design.  There are really but six characters, and one of these episodic, and yet it covers eighteen years, and will be, I imagine, the longest of my works.—Yours ever,</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR DR. CHARTERIS,—The funeral letter, your notes, and many other things, are reserved for a book, <hi rend="italic">Memorials of a Scottish Family</hi>, if ever I can find time and opportunity.  I wish I could throw off all else and sit down to it to-day.  Yes, my father was a ‘distinctly religious man,’ but not a pious.  The distinction painfully and pleasurably recalls old conflicts; it used to be my great gun—and you, who suffered for the whole Church, know how needful it was to have some reserve artillery!  His sentiments were tragic; he was a tragic thinker.  Now, granted that life is tragic to the marrow, it seems the proper function of religion to make us accept and serve in that tragedy, as officers in that other and comparable one of war.  Service is the word, active service, in the military sense; and the religious man—I beg pardon, the pious man—is he who has a military joy in duty—not he who weeps over the wounded.  We can do no more than try to do our best.  Really, I am the grandson of the manse—I preach you a kind of sermon.  Box the brat’s ears!</p>
                     <p>My mother—to pass to matters more within my competence—finely enjoys herself.  The new country, some new friends we have made, the interesting experiment of this climate-which (at least) is tragic—all have done her good.  I have myself passed a better winter than for years, and now that it is nearly over have some diffident hopes of doing well in the summer and ‘eating a little more air’ than usual.</p>
                     <p>I thank you for the trouble you are taking, and my mother joins with me in kindest regards to yourself and Mrs. Charteris.—Yours very truly,</p>
                     <p>Robert Louis Stevenson.</p>

                     <p>DEAR MINISTER OF THE FREE KIRK AT PENICUIK,—For O, man, I cannae read your name!—That I have been so long in answering your delightful letter sits on my conscience badly.  The fact is I let my correspondence accumulate until I am going to leave a place; and then I pitch in, overhaul the pile, and my cries of penitence might be heard a mile about.  Yesterday I despatched thirty-five belated letters: conceive the state of my conscience, above all as the Sins of Omission (see boyhood’s guide, the Shorter Catechism) are in my view the only serious ones; I call it my view, but it cannot have escaped you that it was also Christ’s.  However, all that is not to the purpose, which is to thank you for the sincere pleasure afforded by your charming letter.  I get a good few such; how few that please me at all, you would be surprised to learn—or have a singularly just idea of the dulness of our race; how few that please me as yours did, I can tell you in one word—<hi rend="italic">None</hi>.  I am no great kirkgoer, for many reasons—and the sermon’s one of them, and the first prayer another, but the chief and effectual reason is the stuffiness.  I am no great kirkgoer, says I, but when I read yon letter of yours, I thought I would like to sit under ye.  And then I saw ye were to send me a bit buik, and says I, I’ll wait for the bit buik, and then I’ll mebbe can read the man’s name, and anyway I’ll can kill twa birds wi’ ae stane.  And, man! the buik was ne’er heard tell o’!</p>
                     <p>That fact is an adminicle of excuse for my delay.</p>
                     <p>And now, dear minister of the illegible name, thanks to you, and greeting to your wife, and may you have good guidance in your difficult labours, and a blessing on your life.</p>

                     <p>MY DEAREST COGGIE,—I wish I could find the letter I began to you some time ago when I was ill; but I can’t and I don’t believe there was much in it anyway.  We have all behaved like pigs and beasts and barn-door poultry to you; but I have been sunk in work, and the lad is lazy and blind and has been working too; and as for Fanny, she has been (and still is) really unwell.  I had a mean hope you might perhaps write again before I got up steam: I could not have been more ashamed of myself than I am, and I should have had another laugh.</p>
                     <p>They always say I cannot give news in my letters: I shall shake off that reproach.  On Monday, if she is well enough, Fanny leaves for California to see her friends; it is rather an anxiety to let her go alone; but the doctor simply forbids it in my case, and she is better anywhere than here—a bleak, blackguard, beggarly climate, of which I can say no good except that it suits me and some others of the same or similar persuasions whom (by all rights) it ought to kill.  It is a form of Arctic St. Andrews, I should imagine; and the miseries of forty degrees below zero, with a high wind, have to be felt to be appreciated.  The greyness of the heavens here is a circumstance eminently revolting to the soul; I have near forgot the aspect of the sun—I doubt if this be news; it is certainly no news to us.  My mother suffers a little from the inclemency of the place, but less on the whole than would be imagined.  Among other wild schemes, we have been projecting yacht voyages; and I beg to inform you that Cogia Hassan was cast for the part of passenger.  They may come off!—Again this is not news.  The lad?  Well, the lad wrote a tale this winter, which appeared to me so funny that I have taken it in hand, and some of these days you will receive a copy of a work entitled ‘<hi rend="italic">A Game of Bluff</hi>, by Lloyd Osbourne and Robert Louis Stevenson.’</p>
                     <p>Otherwise he (the lad) is much as usual.  There remains, I believe, to be considered only R. L. S., the house-bond, prop, pillar, bread-winner, and bully of the establishment.  Well, I do think him much better; he is making piles of money; the hope of being able to hire a yacht ere long dances before his eyes; otherwise he is not in very high spirits at this particular moment, though compared with last year at Bournemouth an angel of joy.</p>
                     <p>And now is this news, Cogia, or is it not?  It all depends upon the point of view, and I call it news.  The devil of it is that I can think of nothing else, except to send you all our loves, and to wish exceedingly you were here to cheer us all up.  But we’ll see about that on board the yacht.—Your affectionate friend,</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR COLVIN,—I have been long without writing to you, but am not to blame, I had some little annoyances quite for a private eye, but they ran me so hard that I could not write without lugging them in, which (for several reasons) I did not choose to do.  Fanny is off to San Francisco, and next week I myself flit to New York: address Scribner’s.  Where we shall go I know not, nor (I was going to say) care; so bald and bad is my frame of mind.  Do you know our—ahem!—fellow clubman, Colonel Majendie?  I had such an interesting letter from him.  Did you see my sermon?  It has evoked the worst feeling: I fear people don’t care for the truth, or else I don’t tell it.  Suffer me to wander without purpose.  I have sent off twenty letters to-day, and begun and stuck at a twenty-first, and taken a copy of one which was on business, and corrected several galleys of proof, and sorted about a bushel of old letters; so if any one has a right to be romantically stupid it is I—and I am.  Really deeply stupid, and at that stage when in old days I used to pour out words without any meaning whatever and with my mind taking no part in the performance.  I suspect that is now the case.  I am reading with extraordinary pleasure the life of Lord Lawrence: Lloyd and I have a mutiny novel—</p>
                     <p>(<hi rend="italic">Next morning</hi>, <hi rend="italic">after twelve other letters</hi>)—mutiny novel on hand—a tremendous work—so we are all at Indian books.  The idea of the novel is Lloyd’s: I call it a novel.  ’Tis a tragic romance, of the most tragic sort: I believe the end will be almost too much for human endurance—when the hero is thrown to the ground with one of his own (Sepoy) soldier’s knees upon his chest, and the cries begin in the Beebeeghar.  O truly, you know it is a howler!  The whole last part is—well the difficulty is that, short of resuscitating Shakespeare, I don’t know who is to write it.</p>
                     <p>I still keep wonderful.  I am a great performer before the Lord on the penny whistle.  Dear sir, sincerely yours,</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR GAMEKEEPER,—Your p. c. (proving you a good student of Micawber) has just arrived, and it paves the way to something I am anxious to say.  I wrote a paper the other day—<hi rend="italic">Pulvis et Umbra</hi>;—I wrote it with great feeling and conviction: to me it seemed bracing and healthful, it is in such a world (so seen by me), that I am very glad to fight out my battle, and see some fine sunsets, and hear some excellent jests between whiles round the camp fire.  But I find that to some people this vision of mine is a nightmare, and extinguishes all ground of faith in God or pleasure in man.  Truth I think not so much of; for I do not know it.  And I could wish in my heart that I had not published this paper, if it troubles folk too much: all have not the same digestion, nor the same sight of things.  And it came over me with special pain that perhaps this article (which I was at the pains to send to her) might give dismalness to my <hi rend="italic">Gamekeeper at Home</hi>.  Well, I cannot take back what I have said; but yet I may add this.  If my view be everything but the nonsense that it may be—to me it seems self-evident and blinding truth—surely of all things it makes this world holier.  There is nothing in it but the moral side—but the great battle and the breathing times with their refreshments.  I see no more and no less.  And if you look again, it is not ugly, and it is filled with promise.</p>
                     <p>Pray excuse a desponding author for this apology.  My wife is away off to the uttermost parts of the States, all by herself.  I shall be off, I hope, in a week; but where?  Ah! that I know not.  I keep wonderful, and my wife a little better, and the lad flourishing.  We now perform duets on two D tin whistles; it is no joke to make the bass; I think I must really send you one, which I wish you would correct . . . I may be said to live for these instrumental labours now, but I have always some childishness on hand.—I am, dear Gamekeeper, your indulgent but intemperate Squire,</p>

                     <p>DEAR HOMER ST. GAUDENS,—Your father has brought you this day to see me, and he tells me it is his hope you may remember the occasion.  I am going to do what I can to carry out his wish; and it may amuse you, years after, to see this little scrap of paper and to read what I write.  I must begin by testifying that you yourself took no interest whatever in the introduction, and in the most proper spirit displayed a single-minded ambition to get back to play, and this I thought an excellent and admirable point in your character.  You were also (I use the past tense, with a view to the time when you shall read, rather than to that when I am writing) a very pretty boy, and (to my European views) startlingly self-possessed.  My time of observation was so limited that you must pardon me if I can say no more: what else I marked, what restlessness of foot and hand, what graceful clumsiness, what experimental designs upon the furniture, was but the common inheritance of human youth.  But you may perhaps like to know that the lean flushed man in bed, who interested you so little, was in a state of mind extremely mingled and unpleasant: harassed with work which he thought he was not doing well, troubled with difficulties to which you will in time succeed, and yet looking forward to no less a matter than a voyage to the South Seas and the visitation of savage and desert islands.—Your father’s friend,</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR JAMES,—With what a torrent it has come at last!  Up to now, what I like best is the first number of a <hi rend="italic">London Life</hi>.  You have never done anything better, and I don’t know if perhaps you have ever done anything so good as the girl’s outburst: tip-top.  I have been preaching your later works in your native land.  I had to present the Beltraffio volume to Low, and it has brought him to his knees; he was <hi rend="italic">amazed</hi> at the first part of Georgina’s Reasons, although (like me) not so well satisfied with Part II.  It is annoying to find the American public as stupid as the English, but they will waken up in time: I wonder what they will think of <hi rend="italic">Two Nations</hi>? . . .</p>
                     <p>This, dear James, is a valedictory.  On June 15th the schooner yacht <hi rend="italic">Casco</hi> will (weather and a jealous providence permitting) steam through the Golden Gates for Honolulu, Tahiti, the Galapagos, Guayaquil, and—I hope <hi rend="italic">not</hi> the bottom of the Pacific.  It will contain your obedient ’umble servant and party.  It seems too good to be true, and is a very good way of getting through the green-sickness of maturity which, with all its accompanying ills, is now declaring itself in my mind and life.  They tell me it is not so severe as that of youth; if I (and the <hi rend="italic">Casco</hi>) are spared, I shall tell you more exactly, as I am one of the few people in the world who do not forget their own lives.</p>
                     <p>Good-bye, then, my dear fellow, and please write us a word; we expect to have three mails in the next two months: Honolulu, Tahiti, and Guayaquil.  But letters will be forwarded from Scribner’s, if you hear nothing more definite directly.  In 3 (three) days I leave for San Francisco.—Ever yours most cordially,</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR COLVIN,—From this somewhat (ahem) out of the way place, I write to say how d’ye do.  It is all a swindle: I chose these isles as having the most beastly population, and they are far better, and far more civilised than we.  I know one old chief Ko-o-amua, a great cannibal in his day, who ate his enemies even as he walked home from killing ’em, and he is a perfect gentleman and exceedingly amiable and simple-minded: no fool, though.</p>
                     <p>The climate is delightful; and the harbour where we lie one of the loveliest spots imaginable.  Yesterday evening we had near a score natives on board; lovely parties.  We have a native god; very rare now.  Very rare and equally absurd to view.</p>
                     <p>This sort of work is not favourable to correspondence: it takes me all the little strength I have to go about and see, and then come home and note, the strangeness around us.  I shouldn’t wonder if there came trouble here some day, all the same.  I could name a nation that is not beloved in certain islands—and it does not know it! <ref target="#6855990405419608431_637-h-3.htm.xhtml#footnote114">[114]</ref>  Strange: like ourselves, perhaps, in India!  Love to all and much to yourself.</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR CHARLES,—Last night as I lay under my blanket in the cockpit, courting sleep, I had a comic seizure.  There was nothing visible but the southern stars, and the steersman there out by the binnacle lamp; we were all looking forward to a most deplorable landfall on the morrow, praying God we should fetch a tuft of palms which are to indicate the Dangerous Archipelago; the night was as warm as milk, and all of a sudden I had a vision of—Drummond Street.  It came on me like a flash of lightning: I simply returned thither, and into the past.  And when I remember all I hoped and feared as I pickled about Rutherford’s in the rain and the east wind; how I feared I should make a mere shipwreck, and yet timidly hoped not; how I feared I should never have a friend, far less a wife, and yet passionately hoped I might; how I hoped (if I did not take to drink) I should possibly write one little book, etc. etc.  And then now—what a change!  I feel somehow as if I should like the incident set upon a brass plate at the corner of that dreary thoroughfare for all students to read, poor devils, when their hearts are down.  And I felt I must write one word to you.  Excuse me if I write little: when I am at sea, it gives me a headache; when I am in port, I have my diary crying ‘Give, give.’  I shall have a fine book of travels, I feel sure; and will tell you more of the South Seas after very few months than any other writer has done—except Herman Melville perhaps, who is a howling cheese.  Good luck to you, God bless you.—Your affectionate friend,</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR COLVIN,—Only a word.  Get out your big atlas, and imagine a straight line from San Francisco to Anaho, the N.E. corner of Nukahiva, one of the Marquesas Islands; imagine three weeks there: imagine a day’s sail on August 12th round the eastern end of the island to Tai-o-hae, the capital; imagine us there till August 22nd: imagine us skirt the east side of Ua-pu—perhaps Rona-Poa on your atlas—and through the Bondelais straits to Taaka-uku in Hiva-Oa, where we arrive on the 23rd; imagine us there until September 4th, when we sailed for Fakarava, which we reached on the 9th, after a very difficult and dangerous passage among these isles.  Tuesday, we shall leave for Taiti, where I shall knock off and do some necessary work ashore.  It looks pretty bald in the atlas; not in fact; nor I trust in the 130 odd pages of diary which I have just been looking up for these dates: the interest, indeed, has been <hi rend="italic">incredible</hi>: I did not dream there were such places or such races.  My health has stood me splendidly; I am in for hours wading over the knees for shells; I have been five hours on horseback: I have been up pretty near all night waiting to see where the <hi rend="italic">Casco</hi> would go ashore, and with my diary all ready—simply the most entertaining night of my life.  Withal I still have colds; I have one now, and feel pretty sick too; but not as at home: instead of being in bed, for instance, I am at this moment sitting snuffling and writing in an undershirt and trousers; and as for colour, hands, arms, feet, legs, and face, I am browner than the berry: only my trunk and the aristocratic spot on which I sit retain the vile whiteness of the north.</p>
                     <p>Please give my news and kind love to Henley, Henry James, and any whom you see of well-wishers.  Accept from me the very best of my affection: and believe me ever yours,</p>

                     <p>Never having found a chance to send this off, I may add more of my news.  My cold took a very bad turn, and I am pretty much out of sorts at this particular, living in a little bare one-twentieth-furnished house, surrounded by mangoes, etc.  All the rest are well, and I mean to be soon.  But these Taiti colds are very severe and, to children, often fatal; so they were not the thing for me.  Yesterday the brigantine came in from San Francisco, so we can get our letters off soon.  There are in Papeete at this moment, in a little wooden house with grated verandahs, two people who love you very much, and one of them is</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR CHARLES,—. . . You will receive a lot of mostly very bad proofs of photographs: the paper was so bad.  Please keep them very private, as they are for the book.  We send them, having learned so dread a fear of the sea, that we wish to put our eggs in different baskets.  We have been thrice within an ace of being ashore: we were lost (!) for about twelve hours in the Low Archipelago, but by God’s blessing had quiet weather all the time; and once, in a squall, we cam’ so near gaun heels ower hurdies, that I really dinnae ken why we didnae athegither.  Hence, as I say, a great desire to put our eggs in different baskets, particularly on the Pacific (aw-haw-haw) Pacific Ocean.</p>
                     <p>You can have no idea what a mean time we have had, owing to incidental beastlinesses, nor what a glorious, owing to the intrinsic interest of these isles.  I hope the book will be a good one; nor do I really very much doubt that—the stuff is so curious; what I wonder is, if the public will rise to it.  A copy of my journal, or as much of it as is made, shall go to you also; it is, of course, quite imperfect, much being to be added and corrected; but O, for the eggs in the different baskets.</p>
                     <p>All the rest are well enough, and all have enjoyed the cruise so far, in spite of its drawbacks.  We have had an awfae time in some ways, Mr. Baxter; and if I wasnae sic a verra patient man (when I ken that I <hi rend="italic">have</hi> to be) there wad hae been a braw row; and ance if I hadnae happened to be on deck about three in the marnin’, I <hi rend="italic">think</hi> there would have been <hi rend="italic">murder</hi> done.  The American Mairchant Marine is a kent service; ye’ll have heard its praise, I’m thinkin’; an’ if ye never did, ye can get <hi rend="italic">Twa Years Before the Mast</hi>, by Dana, whaur forbye a great deal o’ pleisure, ye’ll get a’ the needcessary information.  Love to your father and all the family.—Ever your affectionate friend,</p>

                     <p>DEAR GIVER,—I am at a loss to conceive your object in giving me to a person so locomotory as my proprietor.  The number of thousand miles that I have travelled, the strange bed-fellows with which I have been made acquainted, I lack the requisite literary talent to make clear to your imagination.  I speak of bed-fellows; pocket-fellows would be a more exact expression, for the place of my abode is in my master’s righthand trouser-pocket; and there, as he waded on the resounding beaches of Nukahiva, or in the shallow tepid water on the reef of Fakarava, I have been overwhelmed by and buried among all manner of abominable South Sea shells, beautiful enough in their way, I make no doubt, but singular company for any self-respecting paper-cutter.  He, my master—or as I more justly call him, my bearer; for although I occasionally serve him, does not he serve me daily and all day long, carrying me like an African potentate on my subject’s legs?—<hi rend="italic">he</hi> is delighted with these isles, and this climate, and these savages, and a variety of other things.  He now blows a flageolet with singular effects: sometimes the poor thing appears stifled with shame, sometimes it screams with agony; he pursues his career with truculent insensibility.  Health appears to reign in the party.  I was very nearly sunk in a squall.  I am sorry I ever left England, for here there are no books to be had, and without books there is no stable situation for, dear Giver, your affectionate</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR COLVIN,—The cruiser for San Francisco departs to-morrow morning bearing you some kind of a scratch.  This much more important packet will travel by way of Auckland.  It contains a ballant; and I think a better ballant than I expected ever to do.  I can imagine how you will wag your pow over it; and how ragged you will find it, etc., but has it not spirit all the same? and though the verse is not all your fancy painted it, has it not some life?  And surely, as narrative, the thing has considerable merit!  Read it, get a typewritten copy taken, and send me that and your opinion to the Sandwiches.  I know I am only courting the most excruciating mortification; but the real cause of my sending the thing is that I could bear to go down myself, but not to have much MS. go down with me.  To say truth, we are through the most dangerous; but it has left in all minds a strong sense of insecurity, and we are all for putting eggs in various baskets.</p>
                     <p>We leave here soon, bound for Uahiva, Reiatea, Bora-Bora, and the Sandwiches.</p>
                     <p>O, how my spirit languishes<lb/>To step ashore on the Sanguishes;<lb/>For there my letters wait,<lb/>There shall I know my fate.<lb/>O, how my spirit languidges<lb/>To step ashore on the Sanguidges.</p>
                     <p>18<hi rend="italic">th</hi>.—I think we shall leave here if all is well on Monday.  I am quite recovered, astonishingly recovered. It must be owned these climates and this voyage have given me more strength than I could have thought possible.  And yet the sea is a terrible place, stupefying to the mind and poisonous to the temper, the sea, the motion, the lack of space, the cruel publicity, the villainous tinned foods, the sailors, the captain, the passengers—but you are amply repaid when you sight an island, and drop anchor in a new world.  Much trouble has attended this trip, but I must confess more pleasure.  Nor should I ever complain, as in the last few weeks, with the curing of my illness indeed, as if that were the bursting of an abscess, the cloud has risen from my spirits and to some degree from my temper.  Do you know what they called the <hi rend="italic">Casco</hi> at Fakarava?  The <hi rend="italic">Silver Ship</hi>.  Is that not pretty?  Pray tell Mrs. Jenkin, <hi rend="italic">die silberne Frau</hi>, as I only learned it since I wrote her.  I think of calling the book by that name: <hi rend="italic">The Cruise of the Silver Ship</hi>—so there will be one poetic page at least—the title.  At the Sandwiches we shall say farewell to the <hi rend="italic">S. S.</hi> with mingled feelings.  She is a lovely creature: the most beautiful thing at this moment in Taiti.</p>
                     <p>Well, I will take another sheet, though I know I have nothing to say.  You would think I was bursting: but the voyage is all stored up for the book, which is to pay for it, we fondly hope; and the troubles of the time are not worth telling; and our news is little.</p>
                     <p>Here I conclude (Oct. 24th, I think), for we are now stored, and the Blue Peter metaphorically flies.</p>

                     <p>DEAR ARCHER,—Though quite unable to write letters, I nobly send you a line signifying nothing.  The voyage has agreed well with all; it has had its pains, and its extraordinary pleasures; nothing in the world can equal the excitement of the first time you cast anchor in some bay of a tropical island, and the boats begin to surround you, and the tattooed people swarm aboard.  Tell Tomarcher, with my respex, that hide-and-seek is not equal to it; no, nor hidee-in-the-dark; which, for the matter of that, is a game for the unskilful: the artist prefers daylight, a good-sized garden, some shrubbery, an open paddock, and—come on, Macduff.</p>
                     <p>Tomarcher, I am now a distinguished litterytour, but that was not the real bent of my genius.  I was the best player of hide-and-seek going; not a good runner, I was up to every shift and dodge, I could jink very well, I could crawl without any noise through leaves, I could hide under a carrot plant, it used to be my favourite boast that I always <hi rend="italic">walked</hi> into the den.  You may care to hear, Tomarcher, about the children in these parts; their parents obey them, they do not obey their parents; and I am sorry to tell you (for I dare say you are already thinking the idea a good one) that it does not pay one halfpenny.  There are three sorts of civilisation, Tomarcher: the real old-fashioned one, in which children either had to find out how to please their dear papas, or their dear papas cut their heads off.  This style did very well, but is now out of fashion.  Then the modern European style: in which children have to behave reasonably well, and go to school and say their prayers, or their dear papas <hi rend="italic">will know the reason why</hi>.  This does fairly well.  Then there is the South Sea Island plan, which does not do one bit.  The children beat their parents here; it does not make their parents any better; so do not try it.</p>
                     <p>Dear Tomarcher, I have forgotten the address of your new house, but will send this to one of your papa’s publishers.  Remember us all to all of you, and believe me, yours respectably,</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR CHARLES,—Whether I have a penny left in the wide world, I know not, nor shall know, till I get to Honolulu, where I anticipate a devil of an awakening.  It will be from a mighty pleasant dream at least: Tautira being mere Heaven.  But suppose, for the sake of argument, any money to be left in the hands of my painful doer, what is to be done with it?  Save us from exile would be the wise man’s choice, I suppose; for the exile threatens to be eternal.  But yet I am of opinion—in case there should be <hi rend="italic">some</hi> dibs in the hand of the P.D., <hi rend="italic">i.e.</hi> painful doer; because if there be none, I shall take to my flageolet on the high-road, and work home the best way I can, having previously made away with my family—I am of opinion that if — and his are in the customary state, and you are thinking of an offering, and there should be still some funds over, you would be a real good P.D. to put some in with yours and tak’ the credit o’t, like a wee man!  I know it’s a beastly thing to ask; but it, after all, does no earthly harm, only that much good.  And besides, like enough there’s nothing in the till, and there is an end.  Yet I live here in the full lustre of millions; it is thought I am the richest son of man that has yet been to Tautira: I!—and I am secretly eaten with the fear of lying in pawn, perhaps for the remainder of my days, in San Francisco.  As usual, my colds have much hashed my finances.</p>
                     <p>Do tell Henley I write this just after having dismissed Ori the sub-chief, in whose house I live, Mrs. Ori, and Pairai, their adopted child, from the evening hour of music: during which I Publickly (with a k) Blow on the Flageolet.  These are words of truth.  Yesterday I told Ori about W. E. H., counterfeited his playing on the piano and the pipe, and succeeded in sending the six feet four there is of that sub-chief somewhat sadly to his bed; feeling that his was not the genuine article after all.  Ori is exactly like a colonel in the Guards.—I am, dear Charles, ever yours affectionately,</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">Tautira</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Island of Tahiti</hi> [<hi rend="italic">November</hi> 1888].</p>
                     <p>DEAR TOMARCHER,—This is a pretty state of things! seven o’clock and no word of breakfast!  And I was awake a good deal last night, for it was full moon, and they had made a great fire of cocoa-nut husks down by the sea, and as we have no blinds or shutters, this kept my room very bright.  And then the rats had a wedding or a school-feast under my bed.  And then I woke early, and I have nothing to read except Virgil’s <hi rend="italic">Æneid</hi>, which is not good fun on an empty stomach, and a Latin dictionary, which is good for naught, and by some humorous accident, your dear papa’s article on Skerryvore.  And I read the whole of that, and very impudent it is, but you must not tell your dear papa I said so, or it might come to a battle in which you might lose either a dear papa or a valued correspondent, or both, which would be prodigal.  And still no breakfast; so I said ‘Let’s write to Tomarcher.’</p>
                     <p>This is a much better place for children than any I have hitherto seen in these seas.  The girls (and sometimes the boys) play a very elaborate kind of hopscotch.  The boys play horses exactly as we do in Europe; and have very good fun on stilts, trying to knock each other down, in which they do not often succeed.  The children of all ages go to church and are allowed to do what they please, running about the aisles, rolling balls, stealing mamma’s bonnet and publicly sitting on it, and at last going to sleep in the middle of the floor.  I forgot to say that the whips to play horses, and the balls to roll about the church—at least I never saw them used elsewhere—grow ready made on trees; which is rough on toy-shops.  The whips are so good that I wanted to play horses myself; but no such luck! my hair is grey, and I am a great, big, ugly man.  The balls are rather hard, but very light and quite round.  When you grow up and become offensively rich, you can charter a ship in the port of London, and have it come back to you entirely loaded with these balls; when you could satisfy your mind as to their character, and give them away when done with to your uncles and aunts.  But what I really wanted to tell you was this: besides the tree-top toys (Hush-a-by, toy-shop, on the tree-top!), I have seen some real <hi rend="italic">made</hi> toys, the first hitherto observed in the South Seas.</p>
                     <p>This was how.  You are to imagine a four-wheeled gig; one horse; in the front seat two Tahiti natives, in their Sunday clothes, blue coat, white shirt, kilt (a little longer than the Scotch) of a blue stuff with big white or yellow flowers, legs and feet bare; in the back seat me and my wife, who is a friend of yours; under our feet, plenty of lunch and things: among us a great deal of fun in broken Tahitian, one of the natives, the sub-chief of the village, being a great ally of mine.  Indeed we have exchanged names; so that he is now called Rui, the nearest they can come to Louis, for they have no <hi rend="italic">l</hi> and no <hi rend="italic">s</hi> in their language.  Rui is six feet three in his stockings, and a magnificent man.  We all have straw hats, for the sun is strong.  We drive between the sea, which makes a great noise, and the mountains; the road is cut through a forest mostly of fruit trees, the very creepers, which take the place of our ivy, heavy with a great and delicious fruit, bigger than your head and far nicer, called Barbedine.  Presently we came to a house in a pretty garden, quite by itself, very nicely kept, the doors and windows open, no one about, and no noise but that of the sea.  It looked like a house in a fairy-tale, and just beyond we must ford a river, and there we saw the inhabitants.  Just in the mouth of the river, where it met the sea waves, they were ducking and bathing and screaming together like a covey of birds: seven or eight little naked brown boys and girls as happy as the day was long; and on the banks of the stream beside them, real toys—toy ships, full rigged, and with their sails set, though they were lying in the dust on their beam ends.  And then I knew for sure they were all children in a fairy-story, living alone together in that lonely house with the only toys in all the island; and that I had myself driven, in my four-wheeled gig, into a corner of the fairy-story, and the question was, should I get out again?  But it was all right; I guess only one of the wheels of the gig had got into the fairy-story; and the next jolt the whole thing vanished, and we drove on in our sea-side forest as before, and I have the honour to be Tomarcher’s valued correspondent, Teriitepa, which he was previously known as</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR COLVIN,—Twenty days out from Papeete.  Yes, sir, all that, and only (for a guess) in 4° north or at the best 4° 30′, though already the wind seems to smell a little of the North Pole.  My handwriting you must take as you get, for we are speeding along through a nasty swell, and I can only keep my place at the table by means of a foot against the divan, the unoccupied hand meanwhile gripping the ink-bottle.  As we begin (so very slowly) to draw near to seven months of correspondence, we are all in some fear; and I want to have letters written before I shall be plunged into that boiling pot of disagreeables which I constantly expect at Honolulu.  What is needful can be added there.</p>
                     <p>We were kept two months at Tautira in the house of my dear old friend, Ori a Ori, till both the masts of this invaluable yacht had been repaired.  It was all for the best: Tautira being the most beautiful spot, and its people the most amiable, I have ever found.  Besides which, the climate suited me to the ground; I actually went sea-bathing almost every day, and in our feasts (we are all huge eaters in Taiarapu) have been known to apply four times for pig.  And then again I got wonderful materials for my book, collected songs and legends on the spot; songs still sung in chorus by perhaps a hundred persons, not two of whom can agree on their translation; legends, on which I have seen half a dozen seniors sitting in conclave and debating what came next.  Once I went a day’s journey to the other side of the island to Tati, the high chief of the Tevas—<hi rend="italic">my</hi> chief that is, for I am now a Teva and Teriitera, at your service—to collect more and correct what I had already.  In the meanwhile I got on with my work, almost finished the <hi rend="italic">Master of Ballantrae</hi>, which contains more human work than anything of mine but <hi rend="italic">Kidnapped</hi>, and wrote the half of another ballad, the <hi rend="italic">Song of Rahero</hi>, on a Taiarapu legend of my own clan, sir—not so much fire as the <hi rend="italic">Feast of Famine</hi>, but promising to be more even and correct.  But the best fortune of our stay at Tautira was my knowledge of Ori himself, one of the finest creatures extant.  The day of our parting was a sad one.  We deduced from it a rule for travellers: not to stay two months in one place—which is to cultivate regrets.</p>
                     <p>At last our contemptible ship was ready; to sea we went, bound for Honolulu and the letter-bag, on Christmas Day; and from then to now have experienced every sort of minor misfortune, squalls, calms, contrary winds and seas, pertinacious rains, declining stores, till we came almost to regard ourselves as in the case of Vanderdecken.  Three days ago our luck seemed to improve, we struck a leading breeze, got creditably through the doldrums, and just as we looked to have the N.E. trades and a straight run, the rains and squalls and calms began again about midnight, and this morning, though there is breeze enough to send us along, we are beaten back by an obnoxious swell out of the north.  Here is a page of complaint, when a verse of thanksgiving had perhaps been more in place.  For all this time we must have been skirting past dangerous weather, in the tail and circumference of hurricanes, and getting only annoyance where we should have had peril, and ill-humour instead of fear.</p>
                     <p>I wonder if I have managed to give you any news this time, or whether the usual damn hangs over my letter?  ‘The midwife whispered, Be thou dull!’ or at least inexplicit.  Anyway I have tried my best, am exhausted with the effort, and fall back into the land of generalities.  I cannot tell you how often we have planned our arrival at the Monument: two nights ago, the 12th January, we had it all planned out, arrived in the lights and whirl of Waterloo, hailed a hansom, span up Waterloo Road, over the bridge, etc. etc., and hailed the Monument gate in triumph and with indescribable delight.  My dear Custodian, I always think we are too sparing of assurances: Cordelia is only to be excused by Regan and Goneril in the same nursery; I wish to tell you that the longer I live, the more dear do you become to me; nor does my heart own any stronger sentiment.  If the bloody schooner didn’t send me flying in every sort of direction at the same time, I would say better what I feel so much; but really, if you were here, you would not be writing letters, I believe; and even I, though of a more marine constitution, am much perturbed by this bobbery and wish—O ye Gods, how I wish!—that it was done, and we had arrived, and I had Pandora’s Box (my mail bag) in hand, and was in the lively hope of something eatable for dinner instead of salt horse, tinned mutton, duff without any plums, and pie fruit, which now make up our whole repertory.  O Pandora’s Box!  I wonder what you will contain.  As like as not you will contain but little money: if that be so, we shall have to retire to ’Frisco in the <hi rend="italic">Casco</hi>, and thence by sea <hi rend="italic">via</hi> Panama to Southampton, where we should arrive in April.  I would like fine to see you on the tug: ten years older both of us than the last time you came to welcome Fanny and me to England.  If we have money, however, we shall do a little differently: send the <hi rend="italic">Casco</hi> away from Honolulu empty of its high-born lessees, for that voyage to ’Frisco is one long dead beat in foul and at last in cold weather; stay awhile behind, follow by steamer, cross the States by train, stay awhile in New York on business, and arrive probably by the German Line in Southampton.  But all this is a question of money.  We shall have to lie very dark awhile to recruit our finances: what comes from the book of the cruise, I do not want to touch until the capital is repaid.</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR BURLINGAME,—Here at last I have arrived.  We could not get away from Tahiti till Christmas Day, and then had thirty days of calms and squalls, a deplorable passage.  This has thrown me all out of gear in every way.  I plunge into business.</p>
                     <p>1.  <hi rend="italic">The Master</hi>: Herewith go three more parts.  You see he grows in balk; this making ten already, and I am not yet sure if I can finish it in an eleventh; which shall go to you <hi rend="italic">quam primum</hi>—I hope by next mail.</p>
                     <p>2.  <hi rend="italic">Illustrations to M</hi>.  I totally forgot to try to write to Hole.  It was just as well, for I find it impossible to forecast with sufficient precision.  You had better throw off all this and let him have it at once.  <hi rend="italic">Please do</hi>: <hi rend="italic">all</hi>, <hi rend="italic">and at once</hi>: <hi rend="italic">see further</hi>; and I should hope he would still be in time for the later numbers.  The three pictures I have received are so truly good that I should bitterly regret having the volume imperfectly equipped.  They are the best illustrations I have seen since I don’t know when.</p>
                     <p>3.  <hi rend="italic">Money</hi>.  To-morrow the mail comes in, and I hope it will bring me money either from you or home, but I will add a word on that point.</p>
                     <p>4.  My address will be Honolulu—no longer Yacht <hi rend="italic">Casco</hi>, which I am packing off—till probably April.</p>
                     <p>5.  As soon as I am through with <hi rend="italic">The Master</hi>, I shall finish the <hi rend="italic">Game of Bluff</hi>—now rechristened <hi rend="italic">The Wrong Box</hi>.  This I wish to sell, cash down.  It is of course copyright in the States; and I offer it to you for five thousand dollars.  Please reply on this by return.  Also please tell the typewriter who was so good as to be amused by our follies that I am filled with admiration for his piece of work.</p>
                     <p>6.  <hi rend="italic">Master</hi> again.  Please see that I haven’t the name of the Governor of New York wrong (1764 is the date) in part ten.  I have no book of reference to put me right.  Observe you now have up to August inclusive in hand, so you should begin to feel happy.</p>
                     <p>Is this all?  I wonder, and fear not.  Henry the Trader has not yet turned up: I hope he may to-morrow, when we expect a mail.  Not one word of business have I received either from the States or England, nor anything in the shape of coin; which leaves me in a fine uncertainty and quite penniless on these islands.  H.M. <ref target="#6855990405419608431_637-h-3.htm.xhtml#footnote132">[132]</ref> (who is a gentleman of a courtly order and much tinctured with letters) is very polite; I may possibly ask for the position of palace doorkeeper.  My voyage has been a singular mixture of good and ill-fortune.  As far as regards interest and material, the fortune has been admirable; as far as regards time, money, and impediments of all kinds, from squalls and calms to rotten masts and sprung spars, simply detestable.  I hope you will be interested to hear of two volumes on the wing.  The cruise itself, you are to know, will make a big volume with appendices; some of it will first appear as (what they call) letters in some of M’Clure’s papers.  I believe the book when ready will have a fair measure of serious interest: I have had great fortune in finding old songs and ballads and stories, for instance, and have many singular instances of life in the last few years among these islands.</p>
                     <p>The second volume is of ballads.  You know <hi rend="italic">Ticonderoga</hi>.  I have written another: <hi rend="italic">The Feast of Famine</hi>, a Marquesan story.  A third is half done: <hi rend="italic">The Song of Rahero</hi>, a genuine Tahitian legend.  A fourth dances before me.  A Hawaiian fellow this, <hi rend="italic">The Priest’s Drought</hi>, or some such name.  If, as I half suspect, I get enough subjects out of the islands, <hi rend="italic">Ticonderoga</hi> shall be suppressed, and we’ll call the volume <hi rend="italic">South Sea Ballads</hi>.  In health, spirits, renewed interest in life, and, I do believe, refreshed capacity for work, the cruise has proved a wise folly.  Still we’re not home, and (although the friend of a crowned head) are penniless upon these (as one of my correspondents used to call them) ‘lovely but <hi rend="italic">fatil</hi> islands.’  By the way, who wrote the <hi rend="italic">Lion of the Nile</hi>?  My dear sir, that is Something Like.  Overdone in bits, it has a true thought and a true ring of language.  Beg the anonymous from me, to delete (when he shall republish) the two last verses, and end on ‘the lion of the Nile.’  One Lampman has a good sonnet on a ‘Winter Evening’ in, I think, the same number: he seems ill named, but I am tempted to hope a man is not always answerable for his name. <ref target="#6855990405419608431_637-h-3.htm.xhtml#footnote133">[133]</ref>  For instance, you would think you knew mine.  No such matter.  It is—at your service and Mr. Scribner’s and that of all of the faithful—Teriitera (pray pronounce Tayree-Tayra) or (<hi rend="italic">gallicé</hi>) Téri-téra.</p>
                     <p>R. L. S.</p>
                     <p>More when the mail shall come.</p>
                     <p> </p>
                     <p>I am an idiot.  I want to be clear on one point.  Some of Hole’s drawings must of course be too late; and yet they seem to me so excellent I would fain have the lot complete.  It is one thing for you to pay for drawings which are to appear in that soul-swallowing machine, your magazine: quite another if they are only to illustrate a volume.  I wish you to take a brisk (even a fiery) decision on the point; and let Hole know.  To resume my desultory song, I desire you would carry the same fire (hereinbefore suggested) into your decision on the <hi rend="italic">Wrong Box</hi>; for in my present state of benighted ignorance as to my affairs for the last seven months—I know not even whether my house or my mother’s house have been let—I desire to see something definite in front of me—outside the lot of palace doorkeeper.  I believe the said <hi rend="italic">Wrong Box</hi> is a real lark; in which, of course, I may be grievously deceived; but the typewriter is with me.  I may also be deceived as to the numbers of <hi rend="italic">The Master</hi> now going and already gone; but to me they seem First Chop, sir, First Chop.  I hope I shall pull off that damned ending; but it still depresses me: this is your doing, Mr. Burlingame: you would have it there and then, and I fear it—I fear that ending.</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR CHARLES,—Here we are at Honolulu, and have dismissed the yacht, and lie here till April anyway, in a fine state of haze, which I am yet in hopes some letter of yours (still on the way) may dissipate.  No money, and not one word as to money!  However, I have got the yacht paid off in triumph, I think; and though we stay here impignorate, it should not be for long, even if you bring us no extra help from home.  The cruise has been a great success, both as to matter, fun, and health; and yet, Lord, man! we’re pleased to be ashore!  Yon was a very fine voyage from Tahiti up here, but—the dry land’s a fine place too, and we don’t mind squalls any longer, and eh, man, that’s a great thing.  Blow, blow, thou wintry wind, thou hast done me no appreciable harm beyond a few grey hairs!  Altogether, this foolhardy venture is achieved; and if I have but nine months of life and any kind of health, I shall have both eaten my cake and got it back again with usury.  But, man, there have been days when I felt guilty, and thought I was in no position for the head of a house.</p>
                     <p>Your letter and accounts are doubtless at S. F., and will reach me in course.  My wife is no great shakes; she is the one who has suffered most.  My mother has had a Huge Old Time; Lloyd is first chop; I so well that I do not know myself—sea-bathing, if you please, and what is far more dangerous, entertaining and being entertained by His Majesty here, who is a very fine intelligent fellow, but O, Charles! what a crop for the drink!  He carries it, too, like a mountain with a sparrow on its shoulders.  We calculated five bottles of champagne in three hours and a half (afternoon), and the sovereign quite presentable, although perceptibly more dignified at the end. . . .</p>
                     <p>The extraordinary health I enjoy and variety of interests I find among these islands would tempt me to remain here; only for Lloyd, who is not well placed in such countries for a permanency; and a little for Colvin, to whom I feel I owe a sort of filial duty.  And these two considerations will no doubt bring me back—to go to bed again—in England.—Yours ever affectionately,</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR BOB,—My extremely foolhardy venture is practically over.  How foolhardy it was I don’t think I realised.  We had a very small schooner, and, like most yachts, over-rigged and over-sparred, and like many American yachts on a very dangerous sail plan.  The waters we sailed in are, of course, entirely unlighted, and very badly charted; in the Dangerous Archipelago, through which we were fools enough to go, we were perfectly in ignorance of where we were for a whole night and half the next day, and this in the midst of invisible islands and rapid and variable currents; and we were lucky when we found our whereabouts at last.  We have twice had all we wanted in the way of squalls: once, as I came on deck, I found the green sea over the cockpit coamings and running down the companion like a brook to meet me; at that same moment the foresail sheet jammed and the captain had no knife; this was the only occasion on the cruise that ever I set a hand to a rope, but I worked like a Trojan, judging the possibility of hæmorrhage better than the certainty of drowning.  Another time I saw a rather singular thing: our whole ship’s company as pale as paper from the captain to the cook; we had a black squall astern on the port side and a white squall ahead to starboard; the complication passed off innocuous, the black squall only fetching us with its tail, and the white one slewing off somewhere else.  Twice we were a long while (days) in the close vicinity of hurricane weather, but again luck prevailed, and we saw none of it.  These are dangers incident to these seas and small craft.  What was an amazement, and at the same time a powerful stroke of luck, both our masts were rotten, and we found it out—I was going to say in time, but it was stranger and luckier than that.  The head of the mainmast hung over so that hands were afraid to go to the helm; and less than three weeks before—I am not sure it was more than a fortnight—we had been nearly twelve hours beating off the lee shore of Eimeo (or Moorea, next island to Tahiti) in half a gale of wind with a violent head sea: she would neither tack nor wear once, and had to be boxed off with the mainsail—you can imagine what an ungodly show of kites we carried—and yet the mast stood.  The very day after that, in the southern bight of Tahiti, we had a near squeak, the wind suddenly coming calm; the reefs were close in with, my eye! what a surf!  The pilot thought we were gone, and the captain had a boat cleared, when a lucky squall came to our rescue.  My wife, hearing the order given about the boats, remarked to my mother, ‘Isn’t that nice?  We shall soon be ashore!’  Thus does the female mind unconsciously skirt along the verge of eternity.  Our voyage up here was most disastrous—calms, squalls, head sea, waterspouts of rain, hurricane weather all about, and we in the midst of the hurricane season, when even the hopeful builder and owner of the yacht had pronounced these seas unfit for her.  We ran out of food, and were quite given up for lost in Honolulu: people had ceased to speak to Belle <ref target="#6855990405419608431_637-h-3.htm.xhtml#footnote137">[137]</ref> about the <hi rend="italic">Casco</hi>, as a deadly subject.</p>
                     <p>But the perils of the deep were part of the programme; and though I am very glad to be done with them for a while and comfortably ashore, where a squall does not matter a snuff to any one, I feel pretty sure I shall want to get to sea again ere long.  The dreadful risk I took was financial, and double-headed.  First, I had to sink a lot of money in the cruise, and if I didn’t get health, how was I to get it back?  I have got health to a wonderful extent; and as I have the most interesting matter for my book, bar accidents, I ought to get all I have laid out and a profit.  But, second (what I own I never considered till too late), there was the danger of collisions, of damages and heavy repairs, of disablement, towing, and salvage; indeed, the cruise might have turned round and cost me double.  Nor will this danger be quite over till I hear the yacht is in San Francisco; for though I have shaken the dust of her deck from my feet, I fear (as a point of law) she is still mine till she gets there.</p>
                     <p>From my point of view, up to now the cruise has been a wonderful success.  I never knew the world was so amusing.  On the last voyage we had grown so used to sea-life that no one wearied, though it lasted a full month, except Fanny, who is always ill.  All the time our visits to the islands have been more like dreams than realities: the people, the life, the beachcombers, the old stories and songs I have picked up, so interesting; the climate, the scenery, and (in some places) the women, so beautiful.  The women are handsomest in Tahiti, the men in the Marquesas; both as fine types as can be imagined.  Lloyd reminds me, I have not told you one characteristic incident of the cruise from a semi-naval point of view.  One night we were going ashore in Anaho Bay; the most awful noise on deck; the breakers distinctly audible in the cabin; and there I had to sit below, entertaining in my best style a negroid native chieftain, much the worse for rum!  You can imagine the evening’s pleasure.</p>
                     <p>This naval report on cruising in the South Seas would be incomplete without one other trait.  On our voyage up here I came one day into the dining-room, the hatch in the floor was open, the ship’s boy was below with a baler, and two of the hands were carrying buckets as for a fire; this meant that the pumps had ceased working.</p>
                     <p>One stirring day was that in which we sighted Hawaii.  It blew fair, but very strong; we carried jib, foresail, and mainsail, all single-reefed, and she carried her lee rail under water and flew.  The swell, the heaviest I have ever been out in—I tried in vain to estimate the height, <hi rend="italic">at least</hi> fifteen feet—came tearing after us about a point and a half off the wind.  We had the best hand—old Louis—at the wheel; and, really, he did nobly, and had noble luck, for it never caught us once.  At times it seemed we must have it; Louis would look over his shoulder with the queerest look and dive down his neck into his shoulders; and then it missed us somehow, and only sprays came over our quarter, turning the little outside lane of deck into a mill race as deep as to the cockpit coamings.  I never remember anything more delightful and exciting.  Pretty soon after we were lying absolutely becalmed under the lee of Hawaii, of which we had been warned; and the captain never confessed he had done it on purpose, but when accused, he smiled.  Really, I suppose he did quite right, for we stood committed to a dangerous race, and to bring her to the wind would have been rather a heart-sickening manœuvre.</p>

                     <p>DEAR SIR,—I thank you—from the midst of such a flurry as you can imagine, with seven months’ accumulated correspondence on my table—for your two friendly and clever letters.  Pray write me again.  I shall be home in May or June, and not improbably shall come to Paris in the summer.  Then we can talk; or in the interval I may be able to write, which is to-day out of the question.  Pray take a word from a man of crushing occupations, and count it as a volume.  Your little <hi rend="italic">conte</hi> is delightful.  Ah yes, you are right, I love the eighteenth century; and so do you, and have not listened to its voice in vain.—The Hunted One,</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR CHARLES,—At last I have the accounts: the Doer has done excellently, and in the words of —, ‘I reciprocate every step of your behaviour.’ . .  I send a letter for Bob in your care, as I don’t know his Liverpool address, by which (for he is to show you part of it) you will see we have got out of this adventure—or hope to have—with wonderful fortune.  I have the retrospective horrors on me when I think of the liabilities I incurred; but, thank God, I think I’m in port again, and I have found one climate in which I can enjoy life.  Even Honolulu is too cold for me; but the south isles were a heaven upon earth to a puir, catarrhal party like Johns’one.  We think, as Tahiti is too complete a banishment, to try Madeira.  It’s only a week from England, good communications, and I suspect in climate and scenery not unlike our dear islands; in people, alas! there can be no comparison.  But friends could go, and I could come in summer, so I should not be quite cut off.</p>
                     <p>Lloyd and I have finished a story, <hi rend="italic">The Wrong Box</hi>.  If it is not funny, I am sure I do not know what is.  I have split over writing it.  Since I have been here, I have been toiling like a galley slave: three numbers of <hi rend="italic">The Master</hi> to rewrite, five chapters of the <hi rend="italic">Wrong Box</hi> to write and rewrite, and about five hundred lines of a narrative poem to write, rewrite, and re-rewrite.  Now I have <hi rend="italic">The Master</hi> waiting me for its continuation, two numbers more; when that’s done, I shall breathe.  This spasm of activity has been chequered with champagne parties: Happy and Glorious, Hawaii Ponoi paua: kou moi—(Native Hawaiians, dote upon your monarch!) Hawaiian God save the King.  (In addition to my other labours, I am learning the language with a native moonshee.)  Kalakaua is a terrible companion; a bottle of fizz is like a glass of sherry to him, he thinks nothing of five or six in an afternoon as a whet for dinner.  You should see a photograph of our party after an afternoon with H. H. M.: my! what a crew!—Yours ever affectionately,</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">Honolulu</hi> [<hi rend="italic">March</hi> 1889].</p>
                     <p>MY DEAR JAMES,—Yes—I own up—I am untrue to friendship and (what is less, but still considerable) to civilisation.  I am not coming home for another year.  There it is, cold and bald, and now you won’t believe in me at all, and serve me right (says you) and the devil take me.  But look here, and judge me tenderly.  I have had more fun and pleasure of my life these past months than ever before, and more health than any time in ten long years.  And even here in Honolulu I have withered in the cold; and this precious deep is filled with islands, which we may still visit; and though the sea is a deathful place, I like to be there, and like squalls (when they are over); and to draw near to a new island, I cannot say how much I like.  In short, I take another year of this sort of life, and mean to try to work down among the poisoned arrows, and mean (if it may be) to come back again when the thing is through, and converse with Henry James as heretofore; and in the meanwhile issue directions to H. J. to write to me once more.  Let him address here at Honolulu, for my views are vague; and if it is sent here it will follow and find me, if I am to be found; and if I am not to be found the man James will have done his duty, and we shall be at the bottom of the sea, where no post-office clerk can be expected to discover us, or languishing on a coral island, the philosophic drudges of some barbarian potentate: perchance, of an American Missionary.  My wife has just sent to Mrs. Sitwell a translation (<hi rend="italic">tant bien que mal</hi>) of a letter I have had from my chief friend in this part of the world: go and see her, and get a hearing of it; it will do you good; it is a better method of correspondence than even Henry James’s. <ref target="#6855990405419608431_637-h-3.htm.xhtml#footnote141">[141]</ref>  I jest, but seriously it is a strange thing for a tough, sick, middle-aged scrivener like R. L. S. to receive a letter so conceived from a man fifty years old, a leading politician, a crack orator, and the great wit of his village: boldly say, ‘the highly popular M.P. of Tautira.’  My nineteenth century strikes here, and lies alongside of something beautiful and ancient.  I think the receipt of such a letter might humble, shall I say even —? and for me, I would rather have received it than written <hi rend="italic">Redgauntlet</hi> or the <hi rend="italic">Sixth Æneid</hi>.  All told, if my books have enabled or helped me to make this voyage, to know Rui, and to have received such a letter, they have (in the old prefatorial expression) not been writ in vain.  It would seem from this that I have been not so much humbled as puffed up; but, I assure you, I have in fact been both.  A little of what that letter says is my own earning; not all, but yet a little; and the little makes me proud, and all the rest ashamed; and in the contrast, how much more beautiful altogether is the ancient man than him of to-day!</p>
                     <p>Well, well, Henry James is pretty good, though he <hi rend="italic">is</hi> of the nineteenth century, and that glaringly.  And to curry favour with him, I wish I could be more explicit; but, indeed, I am still of necessity extremely vague, and cannot tell what I am to do, nor where I am to go for some while yet.  As soon as I am sure, you shall hear.  All are fairly well—the wife, your countrywoman, least of all; troubles are not entirely wanting; but on the whole we prosper, and we are all affectionately yours,</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR COLVIN,—I am beginning to be ashamed of writing on to you without the least acknowledgment, like a tramp; but I do not care—I am hardened; and whatever be the cause of your silence, I mean to write till all is blue.  I am outright ashamed of my news, which is that we are not coming home for another year.  I cannot but hope it may continue the vast improvement of my health: I think it good for Fanny and Lloyd; and we have all a taste for this wandering and dangerous life.  My mother I send home, to my relief, as this part of our cruise will be (if we can carry it out) rather difficult in places.  Here is the idea: about the middle of June (unless the Boston Board objects) we sail from Honolulu in the missionary ship (barquentine auxiliary steamer) <hi rend="italic">Morning Star</hi>: she takes us through the Gilberts and Marshalls, and drops us (this is my great idea) on Ponape, one of the volcanic islands of the Carolines.  Here we stay marooned among a doubtful population, with a Spanish vice-governor and five native kings, and a sprinkling of missionaries all at loggerheads, on the chance of fetching a passage to Sydney in a trader, a labour ship, or (maybe, but this appears too bright) a ship of war.  If we can’t get the <hi rend="italic">Morning Star</hi> (and the Board has many reasons that I can see for refusing its permission) I mean to try to fetch Fiji, hire a schooner there, do the Fijis and Friendlies, hit the course of the <hi rend="italic">Richmond</hi> at Tonga Tabu, make back by Tahiti, and so to S. F., and home: perhaps in June 1890.  For the latter part of the cruise will likely be the same in either case.  You can see for yourself how much variety and adventure this promises, and that it is not devoid of danger at the best; but if we can pull it off in safety, gives me a fine book of travel, and Lloyd a fine lecture and diorama, which should vastly better our finances.</p>
                     <p>I feel as if I were untrue to friendship; believe me, Colvin, when I look forward to this absence of another year, my conscience sinks at thought of the Monument; but I think you will pardon me if you consider how much this tropical weather mends my health.  Remember me as I was at home, and think of me sea-bathing and walking about, as jolly as a sandboy: you will own the temptation is strong; and as the scheme, bar fatal accidents, is bound to pay into the bargain, sooner or later, it seems it would be madness to come home now, with an imperfect book, no illustrations to speak of, no diorama, and perhaps fall sick again by autumn.  I do not think I delude myself when I say the tendency to catarrh has visibly diminished.</p>
                     <p>It is a singular tiring that as I was packing up old papers ere I left Skerryvore, I came on the prophecies of a drunken Highland sibyl, when I was seventeen.  She said I was to be very happy, to visit America, and <hi rend="italic">to be much upon the sea</hi>.  It seems as if it were coming true with a vengeance.  Also, do you remember my strong, old, rooted belief that I shall die by drowning?  I don’t want that to come true, though it is an easy death; but it occurs to me oddly, with these long chances in front.  I cannot say why I like the sea; no man is more cynically and constantly alive to its perils; I regard it as the highest form of gambling; and yet I love the sea as much as I hate gambling.  Fine, clean emotions; a world all and always beautiful; air better than wine; interest unflagging; there is upon the whole no better life.—Yours ever,</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR BURLINGAME,—This is to announce the most prodigious change of programme.  I have seen so much of the South Seas that I desire to see more, and I get so much health here that I dread a return to our vile climates.  I have applied accordingly to the missionary folk to let me go round in the <hi rend="italic">Morning Star</hi>; and if the Boston Board should refuse, I shall get somehow to Fiji, hire a trading schooner, and see the Fijis and Friendlies and Samoa.  He would be a South Seayer, Mr. Burlingame.  Of course, if I go in the <hi rend="italic">Morning Star</hi>, I see all the eastern (or western?) islands.</p>
                     <p>Before I sail, I shall make out to let you have the last of <hi rend="italic">The Master</hi>: though I tell you it sticks!—and I hope to have had some proofs forbye, of the verses anyway.  And now to business.</p>
                     <p>I want (if you can find them) in the British sixpenny edition, if not, in some equally compact and portable shape—Seaside Library, for instance—the Waverley Novels entire, or as entire as you can get ’em, and the following of Marryat: <hi rend="italic">Phantom Ship</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Peter Simple</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Percival Keene</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Privateersman</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Children of the New Forest</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Frank Mildmay</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Newton Forster</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Dog Fiend</hi> (<hi rend="italic">Snarleyyow</hi>).  Also <hi rend="italic">Midshipman Easy</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Kingsburn</hi>, Carlyle’s <hi rend="italic">French Revolution</hi>, Motley’s <hi rend="italic">Dutch Republic</hi>, Lang’s <hi rend="italic">Letters on Literature</hi>, a complete set of my works, <hi rend="italic">Jenkin</hi>, in duplicate; also <hi rend="italic">Familiar Studies</hi>, ditto.</p>
                     <p>I have to thank you for the accounts, which are satisfactory indeed, and for the cheque for $1000.  Another account will have come and gone before I see you.  I hope it will be equally roseate in colour.  I am quite worked out, and this cursed end of <hi rend="italic">The Master</hi> hangs over me like the arm of the gallows; but it is always darkest before dawn, and no doubt the clouds will soon rise; but it is a difficult thing to write, above all in Mackellarese; and I cannot yet see my way clear.  If I pull this off, <hi rend="italic">The Master</hi> will be a pretty good novel or I am the more deceived; and even if I don’t pull it off, it’ll still have some stuff in it.</p>
                     <p>We shall remain here until the middle of June anyway; but my mother leaves for Europe early in May.  Hence our mail should continue to come here; but not hers.  I will let you know my next address, which will probably be Sydney.  If we get on the <hi rend="italic">Morning Star</hi>, I propose at present to get marooned on Ponape, and take my chance of getting a passage to Australia.  It will leave times and seasons mighty vague, and the cruise is risky; but I shall know something of the South Seas when it is done, or else the South Seas will contain all there is of me.  It should give me a fine book of travels, anyway.</p>
                     <p>Low will probably come and ask some dollars of you.  Pray let him have them, they are for outfit.  O, another complete set of my books should go to Captain A. H. Otis, care of Dr. Merritt, Yacht <hi rend="italic">Casco</hi>, Oakland, Cal.  In haste,</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR MISS BOODLE,—Nobody writes a better letter than my Gamekeeper: so gay, so pleasant, so engagingly particular, answering (by some delicate instinct) all the questions she suggests.  It is a shame you should get such a poor return as I can make, from a mind essentially and originally incapable of the art epistolary.  I would let the paper-cutter take my place; but I am sorry to say the little wooden seaman did after the manner of seamen, and deserted in the Societies.  The place he seems to have stayed at—seems, for his absence was not observed till we were near the Equator—was Tautira, and, I assure you, he displayed good taste, Tautira being as ‘nigh hand heaven’ as a paper-cutter or anybody has a right to expect.</p>
                     <p>I think all our friends will be very angry with us, and I give the grounds of their probable displeasure bluntly—we are not coming home for another year.  My mother returns next month.  Fanny, Lloyd, and I push on again among the islands on a trading schooner, the <hi rend="italic">Equator</hi>—first for the Gilbert group, which we shall have an opportunity to explore thoroughly; then, if occasion serve, to the Marshalls and Carolines; and if occasion (or money) fail, to Samoa, and back to Tahiti.  I own we are deserters, but we have excuses.  You cannot conceive how these climates agree with the wretched house-plant of Skerryvore: he wonders to find himself sea-bathing, and cutting about the world loose, like a grown-up person.  They agree with Fanny too, who does not suffer from her rheumatism, and with Lloyd also.  And the interest of the islands is endless; and the sea, though I own it is a fearsome place, is very delightful.  We had applied for places in the American missionary ship, the <hi rend="italic">Morning Star</hi>, but this trading schooner is a far preferable idea, giving us more time and a thousandfold more liberty; so we determined to cut off the missionaries with a shilling.</p>
                     <p>The Sandwich Islands do not interest us very much; we live here, oppressed with civilisation, and look for good things in the future.  But it would surprise you if you came out to-night from Honolulu (all shining with electric lights, and all in a bustle from the arrival of the mail, which is to carry you these lines) and crossed the long wooden causeway along the beach, and came out on the road through Kapiolani park, and seeing a gate in the palings, with a tub of gold-fish by the wayside, entered casually in.  The buildings stand in three groups by the edge of the beach, where an angry little spitfire sea continually spirts and thrashes with impotent irascibility, the big seas breaking further out upon the reef.  The first is a small house, with a very large summer parlour, or <hi rend="italic">lanai</hi>, as they call it here, roofed, but practically open.  There you will find the lamps burning and the family sitting about the table, dinner just done: my mother, my wife, Lloyd, Belle, my wife’s daughter, Austin her child, and to-night (by way of rarity) a guest.  All about the walls our South Sea curiosities, war clubs, idols, pearl shells, stone axes, etc.; and the walls are only a small part of a lanai, the rest being glazed or latticed windows, or mere open space.  You will see there no sign of the Squire, however; and being a person of a humane disposition, you will only glance in over the balcony railing at the merry-makers in the summer parlour, and proceed further afield after the Exile.  You look round, there is beautiful green turf, many trees of an outlandish sort that drop thorns—look out if your feet are bare; but I beg your pardon, you have not been long enough in the South Seas—and many oleanders in full flower.  The next group of buildings is ramshackle, and quite dark; you make out a coach-house door, and look in—only some cocoanuts; you try round to the left and come to the sea front, where Venus and the moon are making luminous tracks on the water, and a great swell rolls and shines on the outer reef; and here is another door—all these places open from the outside—and you go in, and find photography, tubs of water, negatives steeping, a tap, and a chair and an inkbottle, where my wife is supposed to write; round a little further, a third door, entering which you find a picture upon the easel and a table sticky with paints; a fourth door admits you to a sort of court, where there is a hen sitting—I believe on a fallacious egg.  No sign of the Squire in all this.  But right opposite the studio door you have observed a third little house, from whose open door lamplight streams and makes hay of the strong moonlight shadows.  You had supposed it made no part of the grounds, for a fence runs round it lined with oleander; but as the Squire is nowhere else, is it not just possible he may be here?  It is a grim little wooden shanty; cobwebs bedeck it; friendly mice inhabit its recesses; the mailed cockroach walks upon the wall; so also, I regret to say, the scorpion.  Herein are two pallet beds, two mosquito curtains, strung to the pitch-boards of the roof, two tables laden with books and manuscripts, three chairs, and, in one of the beds, the Squire busy writing to yourself, as it chances, and just at this moment somewhat bitten by mosquitoes.  He has just set fire to the insect powder, and will be all right in no time; but just now he contemplates large white blisters, and would like to scratch them, but knows better.  The house is not bare; it has been inhabited by Kanakas, and—you know what children are!—the bare wood walls are pasted over with pages from the <hi rend="italic">Graphic</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Harper’s Weekly</hi>, etc.  The floor is matted, and I am bound to say the matting is filthy.  There are two windows and two doors, one of which is condemned; on the panels of that last a sheet of paper is pinned up, and covered with writing.  I cull a few plums:—</p>
                     <p>‘A duck-hammock for each person.</p>
                     <p>A patent organ like the commandant’s at Taiohae.</p>
                     <p>Cheap and bad cigars for presents.</p>
                     <p>Revolvers.</p>
                     <p>Permanganate of potass.</p>
                     <p>Liniment for the head and sulphur.</p>
                     <p>Fine tooth-comb.’</p>
                     <p>What do you think this is?  Simply life in the South Seas foreshortened.  These are a few of our desiderata for the next trip, which we jot down as they occur.</p>
                     <p>There, I have really done my best and tried to send something like a letter—one letter in return for all your dozens.  Pray remember us all to yourself, Mrs. Boodle, and the rest of your house.  I do hope your mother will be better when this comes.  I shall write and give you a new address when I have made up my mind as to the most probable, and I do beg you will continue to write from time to time and give us airs from home.  To-morrow—think of it—I must be off by a quarter to eight to drive in to the palace and breakfast with his Hawaiian Majesty at 8.30: I shall be dead indeed.  Please give my news to Scott, I trust he is better; give him my warm regards.  To you we all send all kinds of things, and I am the absentee Squire,</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR CHARLES,—As usual, your letter is as good as a cordial, and I thank you for it, and all your care, kindness, and generous and thoughtful friendship, from my heart.  I was truly glad to hear a word of Colvin, whose long silence has terrified me; and glad to hear that you condoned the notion of my staying longer in the South Seas, for I have decided in that sense.  The first idea was to go in the <hi rend="italic">Morning Star</hi>, missionary ship; but now I have found a trading schooner, the <hi rend="italic">Equator</hi>, which is to call for me here early in June and carry us through the Gilberts.  What will happen then, the Lord knows.  My mother does not accompany us: she leaves here for home early in May, and you will hear of us from her; but not, I imagine, anything more definite.  We shall get dumped on Butaritari, and whether we manage to go on to the Marshalls and Carolines, or whether we fall back on Samoa, Heaven must decide; but I mean to fetch back into the course of the <hi rend="italic">Richmond</hi>—(to think you don’t know what the <hi rend="italic">Richmond</hi> is!—the steamer of the Eastern South Seas, joining New Zealand, Tongatabu, the Samoas, Taheite, and Rarotonga, and carrying by last advices sheep in the saloon!)—into the course of the <hi rend="italic">Richmond</hi> and make Taheite again on the home track.  Would I like to see the <hi rend="italic">Scots Observer</hi>?  Wouldn’t I not?  But whaur?  I’m direckit at space.  They have nae post offishes at the Gilberts, and as for the Car’lines!  Ye see, Mr. Baxter, we’re no just in the punkshewal <hi rend="italic">centre</hi> o’ civ’lisation.  But pile them up for me, and when I’ve decided on an address, I’ll let you ken, and ye’ll can send them stavin’ after me.—Ever your affectionate,</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR CHARLES,—I am appalled to gather from your last just to hand that you have felt so much concern about the letter.  Pray dismiss it from your mind.  But I think you scarce appreciate how disagreeable it is to have your private affairs and private unguarded expressions getting into print.  It would soon sicken any one of writing letters.  I have no doubt that letter was very wisely selected, but it just shows how things crop up.  There was a raging jealousy between the two yachts; our captain was nearly in a fight over it.  However, no more; and whatever you think, my dear fellow, do not suppose me angry with you or —; although I was <hi rend="italic">annoyed at the circumstance</hi>—a very different thing.  But it is difficult to conduct life by letter, and I continually feel I may be drifting into some matter of offence, in which my heart takes no part.</p>
                     <p>I must now turn to a point of business.  This new cruise of ours is somewhat venturesome; and I think it needful to warn you not to be in a hurry to suppose us dead.  In these ill-charted seas, it is quite on the cards we might be cast on some unvisited, or very rarely visited, island; that there we might lie for a long time, even years, unheard of; and yet turn up smiling at the hinder end.  So do not let me be ‘rowpit’ till you get some certainty we have gone to Davie Jones in a squall, or graced the feast of some barbarian in the character of Long Pig.</p>
                     <p>I have just been a week away alone on the lee coast of Hawaii, the only white creature in many miles, riding five and a half hours one day, living with a native, seeing four lepers shipped off to Molokai, hearing native causes, and giving my opinion as <hi rend="italic">amicus curiæ</hi> as to the interpretation of a statute in English; a lovely week among God’s best—at least God’s sweetest works—Polynesians.  It has bettered me greatly.  If I could only stay there the time that remains, I could get my work done and be happy; but the care of my family keeps me in vile Honolulu, where I am always out of sorts, amidst heat and cold and cesspools and beastly <hi rend="italic">haoles</hi>. <ref target="#6855990405419608431_637-h-3.htm.xhtml#footnote152">[152]</ref>  What is a haole?  You are one; and so, I am sorry to say, am I.  After so long a dose of whites, it was a blessing to get among Polynesians again even for a week.</p>
                     <p>Well, Charles, there are waur haoles than yoursel’, I’ll say that for ye; and trust before I sail I shall get another letter with more about yourself.—Ever your affectionate friend</p>

The goods have come; many daughters have done virtuously, but thou excellest them all.—I have at length finished <hi rend="italic">The Master</hi>; it has been a sore cross to me; but now he is buried, his body’s under hatches,—his soul, if there is any hell to go to, gone to hell; and I forgive him: it is harder to forgive Burlingame for having induced me to begin the publication, or myself for suffering the induction.—Yes, I think Hole has done finely; it will be one of the most adequately illustrated books of our generation; he gets the note, he tells the story—<hi rend="italic">my</hi> story: I know only one failure—the Master standing on the beach.—You must have a letter for me at Sydney—till further notice.  Remember me to Mrs. Will. H., the godlike sculptor, and any of the faithful.  If you want to cease to be a republican, see my little Kaiulani, as she goes through—but she is gone already.  You will die a red, I wear the colours of that little royal maiden, <hi rend="italic">Nous allons chanter à la ronde</hi>, <hi rend="italic">si vous voulez</hi>! only she is not blonde by several chalks, though she is but a half-blood, and the wrong half Edinburgh Scots like mysel’.  But, O Low, I love the Polynesian: this civilisation of ours is a dingy, ungentlemanly business; it drops out too much of man, and too much of that the very beauty of the poor beast: who has his beauties in spite of Zola and Co.  As usual, here is a whole letter with no news: I am a bloodless, inhuman dog; and no doubt Zola is a better correspondent.—Long live your fine old English admiral—yours, I mean—the U.S.A. one at Samoa; I wept tears and loved myself and mankind when I read of him: he is not too much civilised.  And there was Gordon, too; and there are others, beyond question.  But if you could live, the only white folk, in a Polynesian village; and drink that warm, light <hi rend="italic">vin du pays</hi> of human affection, and enjoy that simple dignity of all about you—I will not gush, for I am now in my fortieth year, which seems highly unjust, but there it is, Mr. Low, and the Lord enlighten your affectionate</p>

                     <p>DEAR FANNY,—I had a lovely sail up.  Captain Cameron and Mr. Gilfillan, both born in the States, yet the first still with a strong Highland, and the second still with a strong Lowland accent, were good company; the night was warm, the victuals plain but good.  Mr. Gilfillan gave me his berth, and I slept well, though I heard the sisters sick in the next stateroom, poor souls.  Heavy rolling woke me in the morning; I turned in all standing, so went right on the upper deck.  The day was on the peep out of a low morning bank, and we were wallowing along under stupendous cliffs.  As the lights brightened, we could see certain abutments and buttresses on their front where wood clustered and grass grew brightly.  But the whole brow seemed quite impassable, and my heart sank at the sight.  Two thousand feet of rock making 19° (the Captain guesses) seemed quite beyond my powers.  However, I had come so far; and, to tell you the truth, I was so cowed with fear and disgust that I dared not go back on the adventure in the interests of my own self-respect.  Presently we came up with the leper promontory: lowland, quite bare and bleak and harsh, a little town of wooden houses, two churches, a landing-stair, all unsightly, sour, northerly, lying athwart the sunrise, with the great wall of the pali cutting the world out on the south.  Our lepers were sent on the first boat, about a dozen, one poor child very horrid, one white man, leaving a large grown family behind him in Honolulu, and then into the second stepped the sisters and myself.  I do not know how it would have been with me had the sisters not been there.  My horror of the horrible is about my weakest point; but the moral loveliness at my elbow blotted all else out; and when I found that one of them was crying, poor soul, quietly under her veil, I cried a little myself; then I felt as right as a trivet, only a little crushed to be there so uselessly.  I thought it was a sin and a shame she should feel unhappy; I turned round to her, and said something like this: ‘Ladies, God Himself is here to give you welcome.  I’m sure it is good for me to be beside you; I hope it will be blessed to me; I thank you for myself and the good you do me.’  It seemed to cheer her up; but indeed I had scarce said it when we were at the landing-stairs, and there was a great crowd, hundreds of (God save us!) pantomime masks in poor human flesh, waiting to receive the sisters and the new patients.</p>
                     <p>Every hand was offered: I had gloves, but I had made up my mind on the boat’s voyage <hi rend="italic">not</hi> to give my hand; that seemed less offensive than the gloves.  So the sisters and I went up among that crew, and presently I got aside (for I felt I had no business there) and set off on foot across the promontory, carrying my wrap and the camera.  All horror was quite gone from me: to see these dread creatures smile and look happy was beautiful.  On my way through Kalaupapa I was exchanging cheerful <hi rend="italic">alohas</hi> with the patients coming galloping over on their horses; I was stopping to gossip at house-doors; I was happy, only ashamed of myself that I was here for no good.  One woman was pretty, and spoke good English, and was infinitely engaging and (in the old phrase) towardly; she thought I was the new white patient; and when she found I was only a visitor, a curious change came in her face and voice—the only sad thing, morally sad, I mean—that I met that morning.  But for all that, they tell me none want to leave.  Beyond Kalaupapa the houses became rare; dry stone dykes, grassy, stony land, one sick pandanus; a dreary country; from overhead in the little clinging wood shogs of the pali chirruping of birds fell; the low sun was right in my face; the trade blew pure and cool and delicious; I felt as right as ninepence, and stopped and chatted with the patients whom I still met on their horses, with not the least disgust.  About half-way over, I met the superintendent (a leper) with a horse for me, and O, wasn’t I glad!  But the horse was one of those curious, dogged, cranky brutes that always dully want to go somewhere else, and my traffic with him completed my crushing fatigue.  I got to the guest-house, an empty house with several rooms, kitchen, bath, etc.  There was no one there, and I let the horse go loose in the garden, lay down on the bed, and fell asleep.</p>
                     <p>Dr. Swift woke me and gave me breakfast, then I came back and slept again while he was at the dispensary, and he woke me for dinner; and I came back and slept again, and he woke me about six for supper; and then in about an hour I felt tired again, and came up to my solitary guest-house, played the flageolet, and am now writing to you.  As yet, you see, I have seen nothing of the settlement, and my crushing fatigue (though I believe that was moral and a measure of my cowardice) and the doctor’s opinion make me think the pali hopeless.  ‘You don’t look a strong man,’ said the doctor; ‘but are you sound?’  I told him the truth; then he said it was out of the question, and if I were to get up at all, I must be carried up.  But, as it seems, men as well as horses continually fall on this ascent: the doctor goes up with a change of clothes—it is plain that to be carried would in itself be very fatiguing to both mind and body; and I should then be at the beginning of thirteen miles of mountain road to be ridden against time.  How should I come through?  I hope you will think me right in my decision: I mean to stay, and shall not be back in Honolulu till Saturday, June first.  You must all do the best you can to make ready.</p>
                     <p>Dr. Swift has a wife and an infant son, beginning to toddle and run, and they live here as composed as brick and mortar—at least the wife does, a Kentucky German, a fine enough creature, I believe, who was quite amazed at the sisters shedding tears!  How strange is mankind!  Gilfillan too, a good fellow I think, and far from a stupid, kept up his hard Lowland Scottish talk in the boat while the sister was covering her face; but I believe he knew, and did it (partly) in embarrassment, and part perhaps in mistaken kindness.  And that was one reason, too, why I made my speech to them.  Partly, too, I did it, because I was ashamed to do so, and remembered one of my golden rules, ‘When you are ashamed to speak, speak up at once.’  But, mind you, that rule is only golden with strangers; with your own folks, there are other considerations.  This is a strange place to be in.  A bell has been sounded at intervals while I wrote, now all is still but a musical humming of the sea, not unlike the sound of telegraph wires; the night is quite cool and pitch dark, with a small fine rain; one light over in the leper settlement, one cricket whistling in the garden, my lamp here by my bedside, and my pen cheeping between my inky fingers.</p>
                     <p>Next day, lovely morning, slept all night, 80° in the shade, strong, sweet Anaho trade-wind.</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR COLVIN,—I am just home after twelve days journey to Molokai, seven of them at the leper settlement, where I can only say that the sight of so much courage, cheerfulness, and devotion strung me too high to mind the infinite pity and horror of the sights.  I used to ride over from Kalawao to Kalaupapa (about three miles across the promontory, the cliff-wall, ivied with forest and yet inaccessible from steepness, on my left), go to the Sisters’ home, which is a miracle of neatness, play a game of croquet with seven leper girls (90° in the shade), got a little old-maid meal served me by the Sisters, and ride home again, tired enough, but not too tired.  The girls have all dolls, and love dressing them.  You who know so many ladies delicately clad, and they who know so many dressmakers, please make it known it would be an acceptable gift to send scraps for doll dressmaking to the Reverend Sister Maryanne, Bishop Home, Kalaupapa, Molokai, Hawaiian Islands.</p>
                     <p>I have seen sights that cannot be told, and heard stories that cannot be repeated: yet I never admired my poor race so much, nor (strange as it may seem) loved life more than in the settlement.  A horror of moral beauty broods over the place: that’s like bad Victor Hugo, but it is the only way I can express the sense that lived with me all these days.  And this even though it was in great part Catholic, and my sympathies flew never with so much difficulty as towards Catholic virtues.  The pass-book kept with heaven stirs me to anger and laughter.  One of the sisters calls the place ‘the ticket office to heaven.’  Well, what is the odds?  They do their darg and do it with kindness and efficiency incredible; and we must take folk’s virtues as we find them, and love the better part.  Of old Damien, whose weaknesses and worse perhaps I heard fully, I think only the more.  It was a European peasant: dirty, bigoted, untruthful, unwise, tricky, but superb with generosity, residual candour and fundamental good-humour: convince him he had done wrong (it might take hours of insult) and he would undo what he had done and like his corrector better.  A man, with all the grime and paltriness of mankind, but a saint and hero all the more for that.  The place as regards scenery is grand, gloomy, and bleak.  Mighty mountain walls descending sheer along the whole face of the island into a sea unusually deep; the front of the mountain ivied and furred with clinging forest, one viridescent cliff: about half-way from east to west, the low, bare, stony promontory edged in between the cliff and the ocean; the two little towns (Kalawao and Kalaupapa) seated on either side of it, as bare almost as bathing machines upon a beach; and the population—gorgons and chimaeras dire.  All this tear of the nerves I bore admirably; and the day after I got away, rode twenty miles along the opposite coast and up into the mountains: they call it twenty, I am doubtful of the figures: I should guess it nearer twelve; but let me take credit for what residents allege; and I was riding again the day after, so I need say no more about health.  Honolulu does not agree with me at all: I am always out of sorts there, with slight headache, blood to the head, etc.  I had a good deal of work to do and did it with miserable difficulty; and yet all the time I have been gaining strength, as you see, which is highly encouraging.  By the time I am done with this cruise I shall have the material for a very singular book of travels: names of strange stories and characters, cannibals, pirates, ancient legends, old Polynesian poetry,—never was so generous a farrago.  I am going down now to get the story of a shipwrecked family, who were fifteen months on an island with a murderer: there is a specimen.  The Pacific is a strange place; the nineteenth century only exists there in spots: all round, it is a no man’s land of the ages, a stir-about of epochs and races, barbarisms and civilisations, virtues and crimes.</p>
                     <p>It is good of you to let me stay longer, but if I had known how ill you were, I should be now on my way home.  I had chartered my schooner and made all arrangements before (at last) we got definite news.  I feel highly guilty; I should be back to insult and worry you a little.  Our address till further notice is to be c/o R. Towns and Co., Sydney.  That is final: I only got the arrangement made yesterday; but you may now publish it abroad.—Yours ever,</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR JAMES PAYN,—I get sad news of you here at my offsetting for further voyages: I wish I could say what I feel.  Sure there was never any man less deserved this calamity; for I have heard you speak time and again, and I remember nothing that was unkind, nothing that was untrue, nothing that was not helpful, from your lips.  It is the ill-talkers that should hear no more.  God knows, I know no word of consolation; but I do feel your trouble.  You are the more open to letters now; let me talk to you for two pages.  I have nothing but happiness to tell; and you may bless God you are a man so sound-hearted that (even in the freshness of your calamity) I can come to you with my own good fortune unashamed and secure of sympathy.  It is a good thing to be a good man, whether deaf or whether dumb; and of all our fellow-craftsmen (whom yet they count a jealous race), I never knew one but gave you the name of honesty and kindness: come to think of it gravely, this is better than the finest hearing.  We are all on the march to deafness, blindness, and all conceivable and fatal disabilities; we shall not all get there with a report so good.  My good news is a health astonishingly reinstated.  This climate; these voyagings; these landfalls at dawn; new islands peaking from the morning bank; new forested harbours; new passing alarms of squalls and surf; new interests of gentle natives,—the whole tale of my life is better to me than any poem.</p>
                     <p>I am fresh just now from the leper settlement of Molokai, playing croquet with seven leper girls, sitting and yarning with old, blind, leper beachcombers in the hospital, sickened with the spectacle of abhorrent suffering and deformation amongst the patients, touched to the heart by the sight of lovely and effective virtues in their helpers: no stranger time have I ever had, nor any so moving.  I do not think it a little thing to be deaf, God knows, and God defend me from the same!—but to be a leper, of one of the self-condemned, how much more awful! and yet there’s a way there also.  ‘There are Molokais everywhere,’ said Mr. Dutton, Father Damien’s dresser; you are but new landed in yours; and my dear and kind adviser, I wish you, with all my soul, that patience and courage which you will require.  Think of me meanwhile on a trading schooner, bound for the Gilbert Islands, thereafter for the Marshalls, with a diet of fish and cocoanut before me; bound on a cruise of—well, of investigation to what islands we can reach, and to get (some day or other) to Sydney, where a letter addressed to the care of R. Towns &amp; Co. will find me sooner or later; and if it contain any good news, whether of your welfare or the courage with which you bear the contrary, will do me good.—Yours affectionately (although so near a stranger),</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR COLVIN,—The missionary ship is outside the reef trying (vainly) to get in; so I may have a chance to get a line off.  I am glad to say I shall be home by June next for the summer, or we shall know the reason why.  For God’s sake be well and jolly for the meeting.  I shall be, I believe, a different character from what you have seen this long while.  This cruise is up to now a huge success, being interesting, pleasant, and profitable.  The beachcomber is perhaps the most interesting character here; the natives are very different, on the whole, from Polynesians: they are moral, stand-offish (for good reasons), and protected by a dark tongue.  It is delightful to meet the few Hawaiians (mostly missionaries) that are dotted about, with their Italian <hi rend="italic">brio</hi> and their ready friendliness.  The whites are a strange lot, many of them good, kind, pleasant fellows; others quite the lowest I have ever seen even in the slums of cities.  I wish I had time to narrate to you the doings and character of three white murderers (more or less proven) I have met.  One, the only undoubted assassin of the lot, quite gained my affection in his big home out of a wreck, with his New Hebrides wife in her savage turban of hair and yet a perfect lady, and his three adorable little girls in Rob Roy Macgregor dresses, dancing to the hand organ, performing circus on the floor with startling effects of nudity, and curling up together on a mat to sleep, three sizes, three attitudes, three Rob Roy dresses, and six little clenched fists: the murderer meanwhile brooding and gloating over his chicks, till your whole heart went out to him; and yet his crime on the face of it was dark: disembowelling, in his own house, an old man of seventy, and him drunk.</p>
                     <p>It is lunch-time, I see, and I must close up with my warmest love to you.  I wish you were here to sit upon me when required.  Ah! if you were but a good sailor!  I will never leave the sea, I think; it is only there that a Briton lives: my poor grandfather, it is from him I inherit the taste, I fancy, and he was round many islands in his day; but I, please God, shall beat him at that before the recall is sounded.  Would you be surprised to learn that I contemplate becoming a shipowner?  I do, but it is a secret.  Life is far better fun than people dream who fall asleep among the chimney stacks and telegraph wires.</p>
                     <p>Love to Henry James and others near.—Ever yours, my dear fellow,</p>

                     <p>No <hi rend="italic">Morning Star</hi> came, however; and so now I try to send this to you by the schooner <hi rend="italic">J. L. Tiernan</hi>.  We have been about a month ashore, camping out in a kind of town the king set up for us: on the idea that I was really a ‘big chief’ in England.  He dines with us sometimes, and sends up a cook for a share of our meals when he does not come himself.  This sounds like high living! alas, undeceive yourself.  Salt junk is the mainstay; a low island, except for cocoanuts, is just the same as a ship at sea: brackish water, no supplies, and very little shelter.  The king is a great character—a thorough tyrant, very much of a gentleman, a poet, a musician, a historian, or perhaps rather more a genealogist—it is strange to see him lying in his house among a lot of wives (nominal wives) writing the History of Apemama in an account-book; his description of one of his own songs, which he sang to me himself, as ‘about sweethearts, and trees, and the sea—and no true, all-the-same lie,’ seems about as compendious a definition of lyric poetry as a man could ask.  Tembinoka is here the great attraction: all the rest is heat and tedium and villainous dazzle, and yet more villainous mosquitoes.  We are like to be here, however, many a long week before we get away, and then whither?  A strange trade this voyaging: so vague, so bound-down, so helpless.  Fanny has been planting some vegetables, and we have actually onions and radishes coming up: ah, onion-despiser, were you but awhile in a low island, how your heart would leap at sight of a coster’s barrow!  I think I could shed tears over a dish of turnips.  No doubt we shall all be glad to say farewell to low islands—I had near said for ever.  They are very tame; and I begin to read up the directory, and pine for an island with a profile, a running brook, or were it only a well among the rocks.  The thought of a mango came to me early this morning and set my greed on edge; but you do not know what a mango is, so—.</p>
                     <p>I have been thinking a great deal of you and the Monument of late, and even tried to get my thoughts into a poem, hitherto without success.  God knows how you are: I begin to weary dreadfully to see you—well, in nine months, I hope; but that seems a long time.  I wonder what has befallen me too, that flimsy part of me that lives (or dwindles) in the public mind; and what has befallen <hi rend="italic">The Master</hi>, and what kind of a Box the Merry Box has been found.  It is odd to know nothing of all this.  We had an old woman to do devil-work for you about a month ago, in a Chinaman’s house on Apaiang (August 23rd or 24th).  You should have seen the crone with a noble masculine face, like that of an old crone [<hi rend="italic">sic</hi>], a body like a man’s (naked all but the feathery female girdle), knotting cocoanut leaves and muttering spells: Fanny and I, and the good captain of the <hi rend="italic">Equator</hi>, and the Chinaman and his native wife and sister-in-law, all squatting on the floor about the sibyl; and a crowd of dark faces watching from behind her shoulder (she sat right in the doorway) and tittering aloud with strange, appalled, embarrassed laughter at each fresh adjuration.  She informed us you were in England, not travelling and now no longer sick; she promised us a fair wind the next day, and we had it, so I cherish the hope she was as right about Sidney Colvin.  The shipownering has rather petered out since I last wrote, and a good many other plans beside.</p>
                     <p>Health?  Fanny very so-so; I pretty right upon the whole, and getting through plenty work: I know not quite how, but it seems to me not bad and in places funny.</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR COLVIN,—We are just nearing the end of our long cruise.  Rain, calms, squalls, bang—there’s the foretopmast gone; rain, calm, squalls, away with the staysail; more rain, more calm, more squalls; a prodigious heavy sea all the time, and the <hi rend="italic">Equator</hi> staggering and hovering like a swallow in a storm; and the cabin, a great square, crowded with wet human beings, and the rain avalanching on the deck, and the leaks dripping everywhere: Fanny, in the midst of fifteen males, bearing up wonderfully.  But such voyages are at the best a trial.  We had one particularity: coming down on Winslow Reef, p. d. (position doubtful): two positions in the directory, a third (if you cared to count that) on the chart; heavy sea running, and the night due.  The boats were cleared, bread put on board, and we made up our packets for a boat voyage of four or five hundred miles, and turned in, expectant of a crash.  Needless to say it did not come, and no doubt we were far to leeward.  If we only had twopenceworth of wind, we might be at dinner in Apia to-morrow evening; but no such luck: here we roll, dead before a light air—and that is no point of sailing at all for a fore and aft schooner—the sun blazing overhead, thermometer 88°, four degrees above what I have learned to call South Sea temperature; but for all that, land so near, and so much grief being happily astern, we are all pretty gay on board, and have been photographing and draught-playing and sky-larking like anything.  I am minded to stay not very long in Samoa and confine my studies there (as far as any one can forecast) to the history of the late war.  My book is now practically modelled: if I can execute what is designed, there are few better books now extant on this globe, bar the epics, and the big tragedies, and histories, and the choice lyric poetics and a novel or so—none.  But it is not executed yet; and let not him that putteth on his armour, vaunt himself.  At least, nobody has had such stuff; such wild stories, such beautiful scenes, such singular intimacies, such manners and traditions, so incredible a mixture of the beautiful and horrible, the savage and civilised.  I will give you here some idea of the table of contents, which ought to make your mouth water.  I propose to call the book <hi rend="italic">The South Seas</hi>: it is rather a large title, but not many people have seen more of them than I, perhaps no one—certainly no one capable of using the material.</p>

                     <p>Even as so sketched it makes sixty chapters, not less than 300 <hi rend="italic">Cornhill</hi> pages; and I suspect not much under 500.  Samoa has yet to be accounted for: I think it will be all history, and I shall work in observations on Samoan manners, under the similar heads in other Polynesian islands.  It is still possible, though unlikely, that I may add a passing visit to Fiji or Tonga, or even both; but I am growing impatient to see yourself, and I do not want to be later than June of coming to England.  Anyway, you see it will be a large work, and as it will be copiously illustrated, the Lord knows what it will cost.  We shall return, God willing, by Sydney, Ceylon, Suez and, I guess, Marseilles the many-masted (copyright epithet).  I shall likely pause a day or two in Paris, but all that is too far ahead—although now it begins to look near—so near, and I can hear the rattle of the hansom up Endell Street, and see the gates swing back, and feel myself jump out upon the Monument steps—Hosanna!—home again.  My dear fellow, now that my father is done with his troubles, and 17 Heriot Row no more than a mere shell, you and that gaunt old Monument in Bloomsbury are all that I have in view when I use the word home; some passing thoughts there may be of the rooms at Skerryvore, and the black-birds in the chine on a May morning; but the essence is S. C. and the Museum.  Suppose, by some damned accident, you were no more: well, I should return just the same, because of my mother and Lloyd, whom I now think to send to Cambridge; but all the spring would have gone out of me, and ninety per cent. of the attraction lost.  I will copy for you here a copy of verses made in Apemama.</p>
                     <p>I heard the pulse of the besieging sea<lb/>Throb far away all night.  I heard the wind<lb/>Fly crying, and convulse tumultuous palms.<lb/>I rose and strolled.  The isle was all bright sand,<lb/>And flailing fans and shadows of the palm:<lb/>The heaven all moon, and wind, and the blind vault—<lb/>The keenest planet slain, for Venus slept.<lb/>The King, my neighbour, with his host of wives,<lb/>Slept in the precinct of the palisade:<lb/>Where single, in the wind, under the moon,<lb/>Among the slumbering cabins, blazed a fire,<lb/>Sole street-lamp and the only sentinel.<lb/>   To other lands and nights my fancy turned,<lb/>To London first, and chiefly to your house,<lb/>The many-pillared and the well-beloved.<lb/>There yearning fancy lighted; there again<lb/>In the upper room I lay and heard far off<lb/>The unsleeping city murmur like a shell;<lb/>The muffled tramp of the Museum guard<lb/>Once more went by me; I beheld again<lb/>Lamps vainly brighten the dispeopled street;<lb/>Again I longed for the returning morn,<lb/>The awaking traffic, the bestirring birds,<lb/>The consentaneous trill of tiny song<lb/>That weaves round monumental cornices<lb/>A passing charm of beauty: most of all,<lb/>For your light foot I wearied, and your knock<lb/>That was the glad réveillé of my day.<lb/>   Lo, now, when to your task in the great house<lb/>At morning through the portico you pass,<lb/>One moment glance where, by the pillared wall,<lb/>Far-voyaging island gods, begrimed with smoke,<lb/>Sit now unworshipped, the rude monument<lb/>Of faiths forgot and races undivined;<lb/>Sit now disconsolate, remembering well<lb/>The priest, the victim, and the songful crowd,<lb/>The blaze of the blue noon, and that huge voice<lb/>Incessant, of the breakers on the shore.<lb/>As far as these from their ancestral shrine,<lb/>So far, so foreign, your divided friends<lb/>Wander, estranged in body, not in mind.</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR BURLINGAME,—We are now about to rise, like whales, from this long dive, and I make ready a communication which is to go to you by the first mail from Samoa.  How long we shall stay in that group I cannot forecast; but it will be best still to address at Sydney, where I trust, when I shall arrive, perhaps in one month from now, more probably in two or three, to find all news.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Business</hi>.—Will you be likely to have a space in the Magazine for a serial story, which should be, ready, I believe, by April, at latest by autumn?  It is called <hi rend="italic">The Wrecker</hi>; and in book form will appear as number 1 of South Sea Yarns by R. L. S. and Lloyd Osbourne.  Here is the table as far as fully conceived, and indeed executed. <ref target="#6855990405419608431_637-h-3.htm.xhtml#footnote170">[170]</ref> . . .</p>
                     <p>The story is founded on fact, the mystery I really believe to be insoluble; the purchase of a wreck has never been handled before, no more has San Francisco.  These seem all elements of success.  There is, besides, a character, Jim Pinkerton, of the advertising American, on whom we build a good deal; and some sketches of the American merchant marine, opium smuggling in Honolulu, etc.  It should run to (about) three hundred pages of my MS.  I would like to know if this tale smiles upon you, if you will have a vacancy, and what you will be willing to pay.  It will of course be copyright in both the States and England.  I am a little anxious to have it tried serially, as it tests the interest of the mystery.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Pleasure</hi>.—We have had a fine time in the Gilbert group, though four months on low islands, which involves low diet, is a largish order; and my wife is rather down.  I am myself, up to now, a pillar of health, though our long and vile voyage of calms, squalls, cataracts of rain, sails carried away, foretopmast lost, boats cleared and packets made on the approach of a p. d. reef, etc., has cured me of salt brine, and filled me with a longing for beef steak and mangoes not to be depicted.  The interest has been immense.  Old King Tembinoka of Apemama, the Napoleon of the group, poet, tyrant, altogether a man of mark, gave me the woven corselets of his grandfather, his father and his uncle, and, what pleased me more, told me their singular story, then all manner of strange tales, facts and experiences for my South Sea book, which should be a Tearer, Mr. Burlingame: no one at least has had such stuff.</p>
                     <p>We are now engaged in the hell of a dead calm, the heat is cruel—it is the only time when I suffer from heat: I have nothing on but a pair of serge trousers, and a singlet without sleeves of Oxford gauze—O, yes, and a red sash about my waist; and yet as I sit here in the cabin, sweat streams from me.  The rest are on deck under a bit of awning; we are not much above a hundred miles from port, and we might as well be in Kamschatka.  However, I should be honest: this is the first calm I have endured without the added bane of a heavy swell, and the intoxicated blue-bottle wallowings and knockings of the helpless ship.</p>
                     <p>I wonder how you liked the end of <hi rend="italic">The Master</hi>; that was the hardest job I ever had to do; did I do it?</p>
                     <p>My wife begs to be remembered to yourself and Mrs. Burlingame.  Remember all of us to all friends, particularly Low, in case I don’t get a word through for him.—I am, yours very sincerely,</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR BAXTER,—. . . I cannot return until I have seen either Tonga or Fiji or both: and I must not leave here till I have finished my collections on the war—a very interesting bit of history, the truth often very hard to come at, and the search (for me) much complicated by the German tongue, from the use of which I have desisted (I suppose) these fifteen years.  The last two days I have been mugging with a dictionary from five to six hours a day; besides this, I have to call upon, keep sweet, and judiciously interview all sorts of persons—English, American, German, and Samoan.  It makes a hard life; above all, as after every interview I have to come and get my notes straight on the nail.  I believe I should have got my facts before the end of January, when I shall make our Tonga or Fiji.  I am down right in the hurricane season; but they had so bad a one last year, I don’t imagine there will be much of an edition this.  Say that I get to Sydney some time in April, and I shall have done well, and be in a position to write a very singular and interesting book, or rather two; for I shall begin, I think, with a separate opuscule on the Samoan Trouble, about as long as <hi rend="italic">Kidnapped</hi>, not very interesting, but valuable—and a thing proper to be done.  And then, hey! for the big South Sea Book: a devil of a big one, and full of the finest sport.</p>
                     <p>This morning as I was going along to my breakfast a little before seven, reading a number of <hi rend="italic">Blackwood’s Magazine</hi>, I was startled by a soft <hi rend="italic">talofa</hi>, <hi rend="italic">alii</hi> (note for my mother: they are quite courteous here in the European style, quite unlike Tahiti), right in my ear: it was Mataafa coming from early mass in his white coat and white linen kilt, with three fellows behind him.  Mataafa is the nearest thing to a hero in my history, and really a fine fellow; plenty sense, and the most dignified, quiet, gentle manners.  Talking of <hi rend="italic">Blackwood</hi>—a file of which I was lucky enough to find here in the lawyer’s—Mrs. Oliphant seems in a staggering state: from the <hi rend="italic">Wrong Box</hi> to <hi rend="italic">The Master</hi> I scarce recognise either my critic or myself.  I gather that <hi rend="italic">The Master</hi> should do well, and at least that notice is agreeable reading.  I expect to be home in June: you will have gathered that I am pretty well.  In addition to my labours, I suppose I walk five or six miles a day, and almost every day I ride up and see Fanny and Lloyd, who are in a house in the bush with Ah Fu.  I live in Apia for history’s sake with Moors, an American trader.  Day before yesterday I was arrested and fined for riding fast in the street, which made my blood bitter, as the wife of the manager of the German Firm has twice almost ridden me down, and there seems none to say her nay.  The Germans have behaved pretty badly here, but not in all ways so ill as you may have gathered: they were doubtless much provoked; and if the insane Knappe had not appeared upon the scene, might have got out of the muddle with dignity.  I write along without rhyme or reason, as things occur to me.</p>
                     <p>I hope from my outcries about printing you do not think I want you to keep my news or letters in a Blue Beard closet.  I like all friends to hear of me; they all should if I had ninety hours in the day, and strength for all of them; but you must have gathered how hard worked I am, and you will understand I go to bed a pretty tired man.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">December</hi>, [1889].</p>
                     <p>To-morrow (Monday, I won’t swear to my day of the month; this is the Sunday between Christmas and New Year) I go up the coast with Mr. Clarke, one of the London Society missionaries, in a boat to examine schools, see Tamasese, etc.  Lloyd comes to photograph.  Pray Heaven we have good weather; this is the rainy season; we shall be gone four or five days; and if the rain keep off, I shall be glad of the change; if it rain, it will be beastly.  This explains still further how hard pressed I am, as the mail will be gone ere I return, and I have thus lost the days I meant to write in.  I have a boy, Henry, who interprets and copies for me, and is a great nuisance.  He said he wished to come to me in order to learn ‘long expressions.’  Henry goes up along with us; and as I am not fond of him, he may before the trip is over hear some ‘strong expressions.’  I am writing this on the back balcony at Moors’, palms and a hill like the hill of Kinnoull looking in at me; myself lying on the floor, and (like the parties in Handel’s song) ‘clad in robes of virgin white’; the ink is dreadful, the heat delicious, a fine going breeze in the palms, and from the other side of the house the sudden angry splash and roar of the Pacific on the reef, where the warships are still piled from last year’s hurricane, some under water, one high and dry upon her side, the strangest figure of a ship was ever witnessed; the narrow bay there is full of ships; the men-of-war covered with sail after the rains, and (especially the German ship, which is fearfully and awfully top heavy) rolling almost yards in, in what appears to be calm water.</p>
                     <p>Samoa, Apia at least, is far less beautiful than the Marquesas or Tahiti: a more gentle scene, gentler acclivities, a tamer face of nature; and this much aided, for the wanderer, by the great German plantations with their countless regular avenues of palms.  The island has beautiful rivers, of about the bigness of our waters in the Lothians, with pleasant pools and waterfalls and overhanging verdure, and often a great volume of sound, so that once I thought I was passing near a mill, and it was only the voice of the river.  I am not specially attracted by the people; but they are courteous; the women very attractive, and dress lovely; the men purposelike, well set up, tall, lean, and dignified.  As I write the breeze is brisking up, doors are beginning to slam: and shutters; a strong draught sweeps round the balcony; it looks doubtful for to-morrow.  Here I shut up.—Ever your affectionate,</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR SCOTT,—Shameful indeed that you should not have heard of me before!  I have now been some twenty months in the South Seas, and am (up to date) a person whom you would scarce know.  I think nothing of long walks and rides: I was four hours and a half gone the other day, partly riding, partly climbing up a steep ravine.  I have stood a six months’ voyage on a copra schooner with about three months ashore on coral atolls, which means (except for cocoanuts to drink) no change whatever from ship’s food.  My wife suffered badly—it was too rough a business altogether—Lloyd suffered—and, in short, I was the only one of the party who ‘kept my end up.’</p>
                     <p>I am so pleased with this climate that I have decided to settle; have even purchased a piece of land from three to four hundred acres, I know not which till the survey is completed, and shall only return next summer to wind up my affairs in England; thenceforth I mean to be a subject of the High Commissioner.</p>
                     <p>Now you would have gone longer yet without news of your truant patient, but that I have a medical discovery to communicate.  I find I can (almost immediately) fight off a cold with liquid extract of coca; two or (if obstinate) three teaspoonfuls in the day for a variable period of from one to five days sees the cold generally to the door.  I find it at once produces a glow, stops rigour, and though it makes one very uncomfortable, prevents the advance of the disease.  Hearing of this influenza, it occurred to me that this might prove remedial; and perhaps a stronger exhibition—injections of cocaine, for instance—still better.</p>
                     <p>If on my return I find myself let in for this epidemic, which seems highly calculated to nip me in the bud, I shall feel very much inclined to make the experiment.  See what a gulf you may save me from if you shall have previously made it on <hi rend="italic">anima vili</hi>, on some less important sufferer, and shall have found it worse than useless.</p>
                     <p>How is Miss Boodle and her family?  Greeting to your brother and all friends in Bournemouth, yours very sincerely,</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR CHARLES,—I have got one delightful letter from you, and heard from my mother of your kindness in going to see her.  Thank you for that: you can in no way more touch and serve me. . . . Ay, ay, it is sad to sell 17; sad and fine were the old days: when I was away in Apemama, I wrote two copies of verse about Edinburgh and the past, so ink black, so golden bright.  I will send them, if I can find them, for they will say something to you, and indeed one is more than half addressed to you.  This is it—</p>
                     <p>TO MY OLD COMRADES</p>
                     <p>Do you remember—can we e’er forget?—<lb/>How, in the coiled perplexities of youth,<lb/>In our wild climate, in our scowling town,<lb/>We gloomed and shivered, sorrowed, sobbed, and feared?<lb/>The belching winter wind, the missile rain,<lb/>The rare and welcome silence of the snows,<lb/>The laggard morn, the haggard day, the night,<lb/>The grimy spell of the nocturnal town,<lb/>Do you remember?—Ah, could one forget!<lb/>As when the fevered sick that all night long<lb/>Listed the wind intone, and hear at last<lb/>The ever-welcome voice of the chanticleer<lb/>Sing in the bitter hour before the dawn,—<lb/>With sudden ardour, these desire the day:</p>
                     <p>(Here a squall sends all flying.)</p>
                     <p>So sang in the gloom of youth the bird of hope;<lb/>So we, exulting, hearkened and desired.<lb/>For lo! as in the palace porch of life<lb/>We huddled with chimeras, from within—<lb/>How sweet to hear!—the music swelled and fell,<lb/>And through the breach of the revolving doors<lb/>What dreams of splendour blinded us and fled!<lb/>I have since then contended and rejoiced;<lb/>Amid the glories of the house of life<lb/>Profoundly entered, and the shrine beheld:<lb/>Yet when the lamp from my expiring eyes<lb/>Shall dwindle and recede, the voice of love<lb/>Fall insignificant on my closing ears,<lb/>What sound shall come but the old cry of the wind<lb/>In our inclement city? what return<lb/>But the image of the emptiness of youth,<lb/>Filled with the sound of footsteps and that voice<lb/>Of discontent and rapture and despair?<lb/>So, as in darkness, from the magic lamp,<lb/>The momentary pictures gleam and fade<lb/>And perish, and the night resurges—these<lb/>Shall I remember, and then all forget.</p>
                     <p>They’re pretty second-rate, but felt.  I can’t be bothered to copy the other.</p>
                     <p>I have bought 314½ acres of beautiful land in the bush behind Apia; when we get the house built, the garden laid, and cattle in the place, it will be something to fall back on for shelter and food; and if the island could stumble into political quiet, it is conceivable it might even bring a little income. . . . We range from 600 to 1500 feet, have five streams, waterfalls, precipices, profound ravines, rich tablelands, fifty head of cattle on the ground (if any one could catch them), a great view of forest, sea, mountains, the warships in the haven: really a noble place.  Some day you are to take a long holiday and come and see us: it has been all planned.</p>
                     <p>With all these irons in the fire, and cloudy prospects, you may be sure I was pleased to hear a good account of business.  I believed <hi rend="italic">The Master</hi> was a sure card: I wonder why Henley thinks it grimy; grim it is, God knows, but sure not grimy, else I am the more deceived.  I am sorry he did not care for it; I place it on the line with <hi rend="italic">Kidnapped</hi> myself.  We’ll see as time goes on whether it goes above or falls below.</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR BURLINGAME,—I desire nothing better than to continue my relation with the Magazine, to which it pleases me to hear I have been useful.  The only thing I have ready is the enclosed barbaric piece.  As soon as I have arrived in Sydney I shall send you some photographs, a portrait of Tembinoka, perhaps a view of the palace or of the ‘matted men’ at their singing; also T.’s flag, which my wife designed for him: in a word, what I can do best for you.  It will be thus a foretaste of my book of travels.  I shall ask you to let me have, if I wish it, the use of the plates made, and to make up a little tract of the verses and illustrations, of which you might send six copies to H. M. Tembinoka, King of Apemama <hi rend="italic">via</hi> Butaritari, Gilbert Islands.  It might be best to send it by Crawford and Co., S. F.  There is no postal service; and schooners must take it, how they may and when.  Perhaps some such note as this might be prefixed:</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">At my departure from the island of Apemama</hi>, <hi rend="italic">for which you will look in vain in most atlases</hi>, <hi rend="italic">the king and I agreed</hi>, <hi rend="italic">since we both set up to be in the poetical way</hi>, <hi rend="italic">that we should celebrate our separation in verse</hi>.  <hi rend="italic">Whether or not his majesty has been true to his bargain</hi>, <hi rend="italic">the laggard posts of the Pacific may perhaps inform me in six months</hi>, <hi rend="italic">perhaps not before a year</hi>.  <hi rend="italic">The following lines represent my part of the contract</hi>, <hi rend="italic">and it is hoped</hi>, <hi rend="italic">by their pictures of strange manners</hi>, <hi rend="italic">they may entertain a civilised audience</hi>.  <hi rend="italic">Nothing throughout has been invented or exaggerated</hi>; <hi rend="italic">the lady herein referred to as the author’s Muse</hi>, <hi rend="italic">has confined herself to stringing into rhyme facts and legends that I saw or heard during two months’ residence upon the island</hi>.</p>
                     <p>R. L. S.</p>
                     <p>You will have received from me a letter about <hi rend="italic">The Wrecker</hi>.  No doubt it is a new experiment for me, being disguised so much as a study of manners, and the interest turning on a mystery of the detective sort, I think there need be no hesitation about beginning it in the fall of the year.  Lloyd has nearly finished his part, and I shall hope to send you very soon the MS. of about the first four-sevenths.  At the same time, I have been employing myself in Samoa, collecting facts about the recent war; and I propose to write almost at once and to publish shortly a small volume, called I know not what—the War In Samoa, the Samoa Trouble, an Island War, the War of the Three Consuls, I know not—perhaps you can suggest.  It was meant to be a part of my travel book; but material has accumulated on my hands until I see myself forced into volume form, and I hope it may be of use, if it come soon.  I have a few photographs of the war, which will do for illustrations.  It is conceivable you might wish to handle this in the Magazine, although I am inclined to think you won’t, and to agree with you.  But if you think otherwise, there it is.  The travel letters (fifty of them) are already contracted for in papers; these I was quite bound to let M’Clure handle, as the idea was of his suggestion, and I always felt a little sore as to one trick I played him in the matter of the end-papers.  The war-volume will contain some very interesting and picturesque details: more I can’t promise for it.  Of course the fifty newspaper letters will be simply patches chosen from the travel volume (or volumes) as it gets written.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">Excusez du peu</hi>!  And you see what madness it would be to make any fresh engagement.  At the same time, you have <hi rend="italic">The Wrecker</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">War Volume</hi>, if you like either—or both—to keep my name in the Magazine.</p>
                     <p>It begins to look as if I should not be able to get any more ballads done this somewhile.  I know the book would sell better if it were all ballads; and yet I am growing half tempted to fill up with some other verses.  A good few are connected with my voyage, such as the ‘Home of Tembinoka’ sent herewith, and would have a sort of slight affinity to the <hi rend="italic">South Sea Ballads</hi>.  You might tell me how that strikes a stranger.</p>
                     <p>In all this, my real interest is with the travel volume, which ought to be of a really extraordinary interest.</p>
                     <p>I am sending you ‘Tembinoka’ as he stands; but there are parts of him that I hope to better, particularly in stanzas III. and II.  I scarce feel intelligent enough to try just now; and I thought at any rate you had better see it, set it up if you think well, and let me have a proof; so, at least, we shall get the bulk of it straight.  I have spared you Teñkoruti, Tenbaitake, Tembinatake, and other barbarous names, because I thought the dentists in the States had work enough without my assistance; but my chiefs name is Tembinoka, pronounced, according to the present quite modern habit in the Gilberts, Tembinok’.  Compare in the margin Tengkorootch; a singular new trick, setting at defiance all South Sea analogy, for nowhere else do they show even the ability, far less the will, to end a word upon a consonant.  Loia is Lloyd’s name, ship becomes shipé, teapot, tipoté, etc.  Our admirable friend Herman Melville, of whom, since I could judge, I have thought more than ever, had no ear for languages whatever: his Hapar tribe should be Hapaa, etc.</p>
                     <p>But this is of no interest to you: suffice it, you see how I am as usual up to the neck in projects, and really all likely bairns this time.  When will this activity cease?  Too soon for me, I dare to say.</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR JAMES PAYN,—In virtue of confessions in your last, you would at the present moment, if you were along of me, be sick; and I will ask you to receive that as an excuse for my hand of write.  Excuse a plain seaman if he regards with scorn the likes of you pore land-lubbers ashore now.  (Reference to nautical ditty.)  Which I may however be allowed to add that when eight months’ mail was laid by my side one evening in Apia, and my wife and I sat up the most of the night to peruse the same—(precious indisposed we were next day in consequence)—no letter, out of so many, more appealed to our hearts than one from the pore, stick-in-the-mud, land-lubbering, common (or garden) Londoner, James Payn.  Thank you for it; my wife says, ‘Can’t I see him when we get back to London?’  I have told her the thing appeared to me within the spear of practical politix.  (Why can’t I spell and write like an honest, sober, god-fearing litry gent?  I think it’s the motion of the ship.)  Here I was interrupted to play chess with the chief engineer; as I grow old, I prefer the ‘athletic sport of cribbage,’ of which (I am sure I misquote) I have just been reading in your delightful <hi rend="italic">Literary Recollections</hi>.  How you skim along, you and Andrew Lang (different as you are), and yet the only two who can keep a fellow smiling every page, and ever and again laughing out loud.  I joke wi’ deeficulty, I believe; I am not funny; and when I am, Mrs. Oliphant says I’m vulgar, and somebody else says (in Latin) that I’m a whore, which seems harsh and even uncalled for: I shall stick to weepers; a 5s. weeper, 2s. 6d. laugher, 1s. shocker.</p>
                     <p>My dear sir, I grow more and more idiotic; I cannot even feign sanity.  Sometime in the month of June a stalwart weather-beaten man, evidently of seafaring antecedents, shall be observed wending his way between the Athenæum Club and Waterloo Place.  Arrived off No. 17, he shall be observed to bring his head sharply to the wind, and tack into the outer haven.  ‘Captain Payn in the harbour?’—‘Ay, ay, sir.  What ship?’—‘Barquentin R. L. S., nine hundred and odd days out from the port of Bournemouth, homeward bound, with yarns and curiosities.’</p>
                     <p>Who was it said, ‘For God’s sake, don’t speak of it!’ about Scott and his tears?  He knew what he was saying.  The fear of that hour is the skeleton in all our cupboards; that hour when the pastime and the livelihood go together; and—I am getting hard of hearing myself; a pore young child of forty, but new come frae my Mammy, O!</p>
                     <p>Excuse these follies, and accept the expression of all my regards.—Yours affectionately,</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR CHARLES,—I did not send off the enclosed before from laziness; having gone quite sick, and being a blooming prisoner here in the club, and indeed in my bedroom.  I was in receipt of your letters and your ornamental photo, and was delighted to see how well you looked, and how reasonably well I stood. . . . I am sure I shall never come back home except to die; I may do it, but shall always think of the move as suicidal, unless a great change comes over me, of which as yet I see no symptom.  This visit to Sydney has smashed me handsomely; and yet I made myself a prisoner here in the club upon my first arrival.  This is not encouraging for further ventures; Sydney winter—or, I might almost say, Sydney spring, for I came when the worst was over—is so small an affair, comparable to our June depression at home in Scotland. . . . The pipe is right again; it was the springs that had rusted, and ought to have been oiled.  Its voice is now that of an angel; but, Lord! here in the club I dare not wake it!  Conceive my impatience to be in my own backwoods and raise the sound of minstrelsy.  What pleasures are to be compared with those of the Unvirtuous Virtuoso.—Yours ever affectionately, the Unvirtuous Virtuoso,</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">SS.</hi> ‘<hi rend="italic">Janet Nicoll</hi>,’ <hi rend="italic">off Upolu</hi> [<hi rend="italic">Spring</hi> 1890].</p>
                     <p>MY DEAREST COLVIN,—I was sharply ill at Sydney, cut off, right out of bed, in this steamer on a fresh island cruise, and have already reaped the benefit.  We are excellently found this time, on a spacious vessel, with an excellent table; the captain, supercargo, our one fellow-passenger, etc., very nice; and the charterer, Mr. Henderson, the very man I could have chosen.  The truth is, I fear, this life is the only one that suits me; so long as I cruise in the South Seas, I shall be well and happy—alas, no, I do not mean that, and <hi rend="italic">absit omen</hi>!—I mean that, so soon as I cease from cruising, the nerves are strained, the decline commences, and I steer slowly but surely back to bedward.  We left Sydney, had a cruel rough passage to Auckland, for the <hi rend="italic">Janet</hi> is the worst roller I was ever aboard of.  I was confined to my cabin, ports closed, self shied out of the berth, stomach (pampered till the day I left on a diet of perpetual egg-nogg) revolted at ship’s food and ship eating, in a frowsy bunk, clinging with one hand to the plate, with the other to the glass, and using the knife and fork (except at intervals) with the eyelid.  No matter: I picked up hand over hand.  After a day in Auckland, we set sail again; were blown up in the main cabin with calcium fires, as we left the bay.  Let no man say I am unscientific: when I ran, on the alert, out of my stateroom, and found the main cabin incarnadined with the glow of the last scene of a pantomime, I stopped dead: ‘What is this?’ said I.  ‘This ship is on fire, I see that; but why a pantomime?’  And I stood and reasoned the point, until my head was so muddled with the fumes that I could not find the companion.  A few seconds later, the captain had to enter crawling on his belly, and took days to recover (if he has recovered) from the fumes.  By singular good fortune, we got the hose down in time and saved the ship, but Lloyd lost most of his clothes and a great part of our photographs was destroyed.  Fanny saw the native sailors tossing overboard a blazing trunk; she stopped them in time, and behold, it contained my manuscripts.  Thereafter we had three (or two) days fine weather: then got into a gale of wind, with rain and a vexatious sea.  As we drew into our anchorage in a bight of Savage Island, a man ashore told me afterwards the sight of the <hi rend="italic">Janet Nicoll</hi> made him sick; and indeed it was rough play, though nothing to the night before.  All through this gale I worked four to six hours per diem, spearing the ink-bottle like a flying fish, and holding my papers together as I might.  For, of all things, what I was at was history—the Samoan business—and I had to turn from one to another of these piles of manuscript notes, and from one page to another in each, until I should have found employment for the hands of Briareus.  All the same, this history is a godsend for a voyage; I can put in time, getting events co-ordinated and the narrative distributed, when my much-heaving numskull would be incapable of finish or fine style.  At Savage we met the missionary barque <hi rend="italic">John Williams</hi>.  I tell you it was a great day for Savage Island: the path up the cliffs was crowded with gay islandresses (I like that feminine plural) who wrapped me in their embraces, and picked my pockets of all my tobacco, with a manner which a touch would have made revolting, but as it was, was simply charming, like the Golden Age.  One pretty, little, stalwart minx, with a red flower behind her ear, had searched me with extraordinary zeal; and when, soon after, I missed my matches, I accused her (she still following us) of being the thief.  After some delay, and with a subtle smile, she produced the box, gave me <hi rend="italic">one match</hi>, and put the rest away again.  Too tired to add more.—Your most affectionate,</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR BURLINGAME,—I am moved to write to you in the matter of the end papers.  I am somewhat tempted to begin them again.  Follow the reasons <hi rend="italic">pro</hi> and <hi rend="italic">con</hi>:—</p>
                     <p>1st.  I must say I feel as if something in the nature of the end paper were a desirable finish to the number, and that the substitutes of occasional essays by occasional contributors somehow fail to fill the bill.  Should you differ with me on this point, no more is to be said.  And what follows must be regarded as lost words.</p>
                     <p>2nd.  I am rather taken with the idea of continuing the work.  For instance, should you have no distaste for papers of the class called <hi rend="italic">Random Memories</hi>, I should enjoy continuing them (of course at intervals), and when they were done I have an idea they might make a readable book.  On the other hand, I believe a greater freedom of choice might be taken, the subjects more varied and more briefly treated, in somewhat approaching the manner of Andrew Lang in the <hi rend="italic">Sign of the Ship</hi>; it being well understood that the broken sticks <ref target="#6855990405419608431_637-h-3.htm.xhtml#footnote187">[187]</ref> method is one not very suitable (as Colonel Burke would say) to my genius, and not very likely to be pushed far in my practice.  Upon this point I wish you to condense your massive brain.  In the last lot I was promised, and I fondly expected to receive, a vast amount of assistance from intelligent and genial correspondents.  I assure you, I never had a scratch of a pen from any one above the level of a village idiot, except once, when a lady sowed my head full of grey hairs by announcing that she was going to direct her life in future by my counsels.  Will the correspondents be more copious and less irrelevant in the future?  Suppose that to be the case, will they be of any use to me in my place of exile?  Is it possible for a man in Samoa to be in touch with the great heart of the People?  And is it not perhaps a mere folly to attempt, from so hopeless a distance, anything so delicate as a series of papers?  Upon these points, perpend, and give me the results of your perpensions.</p>
                     <p>3rd.  The emolument would be agreeable to your humble servant.</p>
                     <p>I have now stated all the <hi rend="italic">pros</hi>, and the most of the <hi rend="italic">cons</hi> are come in by the way.  There follows, however, one immense Con (with a capital ‘C’), which I beg you to consider particularly.  I fear that, to be of any use for your magazine, these papers should begin with the beginning of a volume.  Even supposing my hands were free, this would be now impossible for next year.  You have to consider whether, supposing you have no other objection, it would be worth while to begin the series in the middle of a volume, or desirable to delay the whole matter until the beginning of another year.</p>
                     <p>Now supposing that the <hi rend="italic">cons</hi> have it, and you refuse my offer, let me make another proposal, which you will be very inclined to refuse at the first off-go, but which I really believe might in time come to something.  You know how the penny papers have their answers to correspondents.  Why not do something of the same kind for the ‘culchawed’?  Why not get men like Stimson, Brownell, Professor James, Goldwin Smith, and others who will occur to you more readily than to me, to put and to answer a series of questions of intellectual and general interest, until at last you should have established a certain standard of matter to be discussed in this part of the Magazine?</p>
                     <p>I want you to get me bound volumes of the Magazine from its start.  The Lord knows I have had enough copies; where they are I know not.  A wandering author gathers no magazines.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">The Wrecker</hi> is in no forrader state than in last reports.  I have indeed got to a period when I cannot well go on until I can refresh myself on the proofs of the beginning.  My respected collaborator, who handles the machine which is now addressing you, has indeed carried his labours farther, but not, I am led to understand, with what we used to call a blessing; at least, I have been refused a sight of his latest labours.  However, there is plenty of time ahead, and I feel no anxiety about the tale, except that it may meet with your approval.</p>
                     <p>All this voyage I have been busy over my <hi rend="italic">Travels</hi>, which, given a very high temperature and the saloon of a steamer usually going before the wind, and with the cabins in front of the engines, has come very near to prostrating me altogether.  You will therefore understand that there are no more poems.  I wonder whether there are already enough, and whether you think that such a volume would be worth the publishing?  I shall hope to find in Sydney some expression of your opinion on this point.  Living as I do among—not the most cultured of mankind (‘splendidly educated and perfect gentlemen when sober’)—I attach a growing importance to friendly criticisms from yourself.</p>
                     <p>I believe that this is the most of our business.  As for my health, I got over my cold in a fine style, but have not been very well of late.  To my unaffected annoyance, the blood-spitting has started again.  I find the heat of a steamer decidedly wearing and trying in these latitudes, and I am inclined to think the superior expedition rather dearly paid for.  Still, the fact that one does not even remark the coming of a squall, nor feel relief on its departure, is a mercy not to be acknowledged without gratitude.  The rest of the family seem to be doing fairly well; both seem less run down than they were on the <hi rend="italic">Equator</hi>, and Mrs. Stevenson very much less so.  We have now been three months away, have visited about thirty-five islands, many of which were novel to us, and some extremely entertaining; some also were old acquaintances, and pleasant to revisit.  In the meantime, we have really a capital time aboard ship, in the most pleasant and interesting society, and with (considering the length and nature of the voyage) an excellent table.  Please remember us all to Mr. Scribner, the young chieftain of the house, and the lady, whose health I trust is better.  To Mrs. Burlingame we all desire to be remembered, and I hope you will give our news to Low, St. Gaudens, Faxon, and others of the faithful in the city.  I shall probably return to Samoa direct, having given up all idea of returning to civilisation in the meanwhile.  There, on my ancestral acres, which I purchased six months ago from a blind Scots blacksmith, you will please address me until further notice.  The name of the ancestral acres is going to be Vailima; but as at the present moment nobody else knows the name, except myself and the co-patentees, it will be safer, if less ambitious, to address R. L. S., Apia, Samoa.  The ancestral acres run to upwards of three hundred; they enjoy the ministrations of five streams, whence the name.  They are all at the present moment under a trackless covering of magnificent forest, which would be worth a great deal if it grew beside a railway terminus.  To me, as it stands, it represents a handsome deficit.  Obliging natives from the Cannibal Islands are now cutting it down at my expense.  You would be able to run your magazine to much greater advantage if the terms of authors were on the same scale with those of my cannibals.  We have also a house about the size of a manufacturer’s lodge.  ’Tis but the egg of the future palace, over the details of which on paper Mrs. Stevenson and I have already shed real tears; what it will be when it comes to paying for it, I leave you to imagine.  But if it can only be built as now intended, it will be with genuine satisfaction and a growunded pride that I shall welcome you at the steps of my Old Colonial Home, when you land from the steamer on a long-merited holiday.  I speak much at my ease; yet I do not know, I may be now an outlaw, a bankrupt, the abhorred of all good men.  I do not know, you probably do.  Has Hyde <ref target="#6855990405419608431_637-h-3.htm.xhtml#footnote190">[190]</ref> turned upon me?  Have I fallen, like Danvers Carew?</p>
                     <p>It is suggested to me that you might like to know what will be my future society.  Three consuls, all at logger-heads with one another, or at the best in a clique of two against one; three different sects of missionaries, not upon the best of terms; and the Catholics and Protestants in a condition of unhealable ill-feeling as to whether a wooden drum ought or ought not to be beaten to announce the time of school.  The native population, very genteel, very songful, very agreeable, very good-looking, chronically spoiling for a fight (a circumstance not to be entirely neglected in the design of the palace).  As for the white population of (technically, ‘The Beach’), I don’t suppose it is possible for any person not thoroughly conversant with the South Seas to form the smallest conception of such a society, with its grog-shops, its apparently unemployed hangers-on, its merchants of all degrees of respectability and the reverse.  The paper, of which I must really send you a copy—if yours were really a live magazine, you would have an exchange with the editor: I assure you, it has of late contained a great deal of matter about one of your contributors—rejoices in the name of <hi rend="italic">Samoa Times and South Sea Advertiser</hi>.  The advertisements in the <hi rend="italic">Advertiser</hi> are permanent, being simply subsidies for its existence.  A dashing warfare of newspaper correspondence goes on between the various residents, who are rather fond of recurring to one another’s antecedents.  But when all is said, there are a lot of very nice, pleasant people, and I don’t know that Apia is very much worse than half a hundred towns that I could name.</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR CHARLES,—I have stayed here a week while Lloyd and my wife continue to voyage in the <hi rend="italic">Janet Nicoll</hi>; this I did, partly to see the convict system, partly to shorten my stay in the extreme cold—hear me with my extreme! <hi rend="italic">moi qui suis originaire d’Edinbourg</hi>—of Sydney at this season.  I am feeling very seedy, utterly fatigued, and overborne with sleep.  I have a fine old gentleman of a doctor, who attends and cheers and entertains, if he does not cure me; but even with his ministrations I am almost incapable of the exertion sufficient for this letter; and I am really, as I write, falling down with sleep.  What is necessary to say, I must try to say shortly.  Lloyd goes to clear out our establishments: pray keep him in funds, if I have any; if I have not, pray try to raise them.  Here is the idea: to install ourselves, at the risk of bankruptcy, in Samoa.  It is not the least likely it will pay (although it may); but it is almost certain it will support life, with very few external expenses.  If I die, it will be an endowment for the survivors, at least for my wife and Lloyd; and my mother, who might prefer to go home, has her own.  Hence I believe I shall do well to hurry my installation.  The letters are already in part done; in part done is a novel for Scribner; in the course of the next twelve months I should receive a considerable amount of money.  I am aware I had intended to pay back to my capital some of this.  I am now of opinion I should act foolishly.  Better to build the house and have a roof and farm of my own; and thereafter, with a livelihood assured, save and repay . . .  There is my livelihood, all but books and wine, ready in a nutshell; and it ought to be more easy to save and to repay afterwards.  Excellent, say you, but will you save and will you repay?  I do not know, said the Bell of Old Bow. . . . It seems clear to me. . . . The deuce of the affair is that I do not know when I shall see you and Colvin.  I guess you will have to come and see me: many a time already we have arranged the details of your visit in the yet unbuilt house on the mountain.  I shall be able to get decent wine from Noumea.  We shall be able to give you a decent welcome, and talk of old days.  <hi rend="italic">Apropos</hi> of old days, do you remember still the phrase we heard in Waterloo Place?  I believe you made a piece for the piano on that phrase.  Pray, if you remember it, send it me in your next.  If you find it impossible to write correctly, send it me <hi rend="italic">à la récitative</hi>, and indicate the accents.  Do you feel (you must) how strangely heavy and stupid I am?  I must at last give up and go sleep; I am simply a rag.</p>
                     <p>The morrow: I feel better, but still dim and groggy.  To-night I go to the governor’s; such a lark—no dress clothes—twenty-four hours’ notice—able-bodied Polish tailor—suit made for a man with the figure of a puncheon—same hastily altered for self with the figure of a bodkin—sight inconceivable.  Never mind; dress clothes, ‘which nobody can deny’; and the officials have been all so civil that I liked neither to refuse nor to appear in mufti.  Bad dress clothes only prove you are a grisly ass; no dress clothes, even when explained, indicate a want of respect.  I wish you were here with me to help me dress in this wild raiment, and to accompany me to M. Noel-Pardon’s.  I cannot say what I would give if there came a knock now at the door and you came in.  I guess Noel-Pardon would go begging, and we might burn the fr. 200 dress clothes in the back garden for a bonfire; or what would be yet more expensive and more humorous, get them once more expanded to fit you, and when that was done, a second time cut down for my gossamer dimensions.</p>
                     <p>I hope you never forget to remember me to your father, who has always a place in my heart, as I hope I have a little in his.  His kindness helped me infinitely when you and I were young; I recall it with gratitude and affection in this town of convicts at the world’s end.  There are very few things, my dear Charles, worth mention: on a retrospect of life, the day’s flash and colour, one day with another, flames, dazzles, and puts to sleep; and when the days are gone, like a fast-flying thaumatrope, they make but a single pattern.  Only a few things stand out; and among these—most plainly to me—Rutland Square,—Ever, my dear Charles, your affectionate friend,</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR BURLINGAME,—</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Ballads</hi>.</p>
                     <p>The deuce is in this volume.  It has cost me more botheration and dubiety than any other I ever took in hand.  On one thing my mind is made up: the verses at the end have no business there, and throw them down.  Many of them are bad, many of the rest want nine years’ keeping, and the remainder are not relevant—throw them down; some I never want to hear of more, others will grow in time towards decent items in a second <hi rend="italic">Underwoods</hi>—and in the meanwhile, down with them!  At the same time, I have a sneaking idea the ballads are not altogether without merit—I don’t know if they’re poetry, but they’re good narrative, or I’m deceived.  (You’ve never said one word about them, from which I astutely gather you are dead set against: ‘he was a diplomatic man’—extract from epitaph of E. L. B.—‘and remained on good terms with Minor Poets.’)  You will have to judge: one of the Gladstonian trinity of paths must be chosen.  (1st) Either publish the five ballads, such as they are, in a volume called <hi rend="italic">Ballads</hi>; in which case pray send sheets at once to Chatto and Windus.  Or (2nd) write and tell me you think the book too small, and I’ll try and get into the mood to do some more.  Or (3rd) write and tell me the whole thing is a blooming illusion; in which case draw off some twenty copies for my private entertainment, and charge me with the expense of the whole dream.</p>
                     <p>In the matter of rhyme no man can judge himself; I am at the world’s end, have no one to consult, and my publisher holds his tongue.  I call it unfair and almost unmanly.  I do indeed begin to be filled with animosity; Lord, wait till you see the continuation of <hi rend="italic">The Wrecker</hi>, when I introduce some New York publishers. . . It’s a good scene; the quantities you drink and the really hideous language you are represented as employing may perhaps cause you one tithe of the pain you have inflicted by your silence on, sir, The Poetaster,</p>
                     <p>R. L. S.</p>
                     <p>Lloyd is off home; my wife and I dwell sundered: she in lodgings, preparing for the move; I here in the club, and at my old trade—bedridden.  Naturally, the visit home is given up; we only wait our opportunity to get to Samoa, where, please, address me.</p>
                     <p>Have I yet asked you to despatch the books and papers left in your care to me at Apia, Samoa?  I wish you would, <hi rend="italic">quam primum</hi>.</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">Union Club</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Sydney</hi>, <hi rend="italic">August</hi> 1890.</p>
                     <p>MY DEAR HENRY JAMES,—Kipling is too clever to live.  The <hi rend="italic">Bête Humaine</hi> I had already perused in Noumea, listening the while to the strains of the convict band.  He a Beast; but not human, and, to be frank, not very interesting.  ‘Nervous maladies: the homicidal ward,’ would be the better name: O, this game gets very tedious.</p>
                     <p>Your two long and kind letters have helped to entertain the old familiar sickbed.  So has a book called <hi rend="italic">The Bondman</hi>, by Hall Caine; I wish you would look at it.  I am not half-way through yet.  Read the book, and communicate your views.  Hall Caine, by the way, appears to take Hugo’s view of History and Chronology.  (<hi rend="italic">Later</hi>; the book doesn’t keep up; it gets very wild.)</p>
                     <p>I must tell you plainly—I can’t tell Colvin—I do not think I shall come to England more than once, and then it’ll be to die.  Health I enjoy in the tropics; even here, which they call sub- or semi-tropical, I come only to catch cold.  I have not been out since my arrival; live here in a nice bedroom by the fireside, and read books and letters from Henry James, and send out to get his <hi rend="italic">Tragic Muse</hi>, only to be told they can’t be had as yet in Sydney, and have altogether a placid time.  But I can’t go out!  The thermometer was nearly down to 50° the other day—no temperature for me, Mr. James: how should I do in England?  I fear not at all.  Am I very sorry?  I am sorry about seven or eight people in England, and one or two in the States.  And outside of that, I simply prefer Samoa.  These are the words of honesty and soberness.  (I am fasting from all but sin, coughing, <hi rend="italic">The Bondman</hi>, a couple of eggs and a cup of tea.)  I was never fond of towns, houses, society, or (it seems) civilisation.  Nor yet it seems was I ever very fond of (what is technically called) God’s green earth.  The sea, islands, the islanders, the island life and climate, make and keep me truly happier.  These last two years I have been much at sea, and I have <hi rend="italic">never wearied</hi>; sometimes I have indeed grown impatient for some destination; more often I was sorry that the voyage drew so early to an end; and never once did I lose my fidelity to blue water and a ship.  It is plain, then, that for me my exile to the place of schooners and islands can be in no sense regarded as a calamity.</p>
                     <p>Good-bye just now: I must take a turn at my proofs.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">N.B.</hi>—Even my wife has weakened about the sea.  She wearied, the last time we were ashore, to get afloat again.—Yours ever,</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR MR. SCHWOB,—<hi rend="italic">Mais</hi>, <hi rend="italic">alors</hi>, <hi rend="italic">vous avez tous les bonheurs</hi>, <hi rend="italic">vous</hi>!  More about Villon; it seems incredible: when it is put in order, pray send it me.</p>
                     <p>You wish to translate the <hi rend="italic">Black Arrow</hi>: dear sir, you are hereby authorised; but I warn you, I do not like the work.  Ah, if you, who know so well both tongues, and have taste and instruction—if you would but take a fancy to translate a book of mine that I myself admired—for we sometimes admire our own—or I do—with what satisfaction would the authority be granted!  But these things are too much to expect.  <hi rend="italic">Vous ne détestez pas alors mes bonnes femmes</hi>? <hi rend="italic">moi</hi>, <hi rend="italic">je les déteste</hi>.  I have never pleased myself with any women of mine save two character parts, one of only a few lines—the Countess of Rosen, and Madame Desprez in the <hi rend="italic">Treasure of Franchard</hi>.</p>
                     <p>I had indeed one moment of pride about my poor <hi rend="italic">Black Arrow</hi>: Dickon Crookback I did, and I do, think is a spirited and possible figure.  Shakespeare’s—O, if we can call that cocoon Shakespeare!—Shakespeare’s is spirited—one likes to see the untaught athlete butting against the adamantine ramparts of human nature, head down, breach up; it reminds us how trivial we are to-day, and what safety resides in our triviality.  For spirited it may be, but O, sure not possible!  I love Dumas and I love Shakespeare: you will not mistake me when I say that the Richard of the one reminds me of the Porthos of the other; and if by any sacrifice of my own literary baggage I could clear the <hi rend="italic">Vicomte de Bragelonne</hi> of Porthos, <hi rend="italic">Jekyll</hi> might go, and the <hi rend="italic">Master</hi>, and the <hi rend="italic">Black Arrow</hi>, you may be sure, and I should think my life not lost for mankind if half a dozen more of my volumes must be thrown in.</p>
                     <p>The tone of your pleasant letters makes me egotistical; you make me take myself too gravely.  Comprehend how I have lived much of my time in France, and loved your country, and many of its people, and all the time was learning that which your country has to teach—breathing in rather that atmosphere of art which can only there be breathed; and all the time knew—and raged to know—that I might write with the pen of angels or of heroes, and no Frenchman be the least the wiser!  And now steps in M. Marcel Schwob, writes me the most kind encouragement, and reads and understands, and is kind enough to like my work.</p>
                     <p>I am just now overloaded with work.  I have two huge novels on hand—<hi rend="italic">The Wrecker</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Pearl Fisher</hi>, <ref target="#6855990405419608431_637-h-3.htm.xhtml#footnote198">[198]</ref> in collaboration with my stepson: the latter, the <hi rend="italic">Pearl Fisher</hi>, I think highly of, for a black, ugly, trampling, violent story, full of strange scenes and striking characters.  And then I am about waist-deep in my big book on the South Seas: <hi rend="italic">the</hi> big book on the South Seas it ought to be, and shall.  And besides, I have some verses in the press, which, however, I hesitate to publish.  For I am no judge of my own verse; self-deception is there so facile.  All this and the cares of an impending settlement in Samoa keep me very busy, and a cold (as usual) keeps me in bed.</p>
                     <p>Alas, I shall not have the pleasure to see you yet awhile, if ever.  You must be content to take me as a wandering voice, and in the form of occasional letters from recondite islands; and address me, if you will be good enough to write, to Apia, Samoa.  My stepson, Mr. Osbourne, goes home meanwhile to arrange some affairs; it is not unlikely he may go to Paris to arrange about the illustrations to my South Seas; in which case I shall ask him to call upon you, and give you some word of our outlandish destinies.  You will find him intelligent, I think; and I am sure, if (<hi rend="italic">par hasard</hi>) you should take any interest in the islands, he will have much to tell you.—Herewith I conclude, and am your obliged and interested correspondent,</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR LANG,—I observed with a great deal of surprise and interest that a controversy in which you have been taking sides at home, in yellow London, hinges in part at least on the Gilbert Islanders and their customs in burial.  Nearly six months of my life has been passed in the group: I have revisited it but the other day; and I make haste to tell you what I know.  The upright stones—I enclose you a photograph of one on Apemama—are certainly connected with religion; I do not think they are adored.  They stand usually on the windward shore of the islands, that is to say, apart from habitation (on <hi rend="italic">enclosed islands</hi>, where the people live on the sea side, I do not know how it is, never having lived on one).  I gathered from Tembinoka, Rex Apemamae, that the pillars were supposed to fortify the island from invasion: spiritual martellos.  I think he indicated they were connected with the cult of Tenti—pronounce almost as chintz in English, the <hi rend="italic">t</hi> being explosive; but you must take this with a grain of salt, for I knew no word of Gilbert Island; and the King’s English, although creditable, is rather vigorous than exact.  Now, here follows the point of interest to you: such pillars, or standing stones, have no connection with graves.  The most elaborate grave that I have ever seen in the group—to be certain—is in the form of a <hi rend="italic">raised border</hi> of gravel, usually strewn with broken glass.  One, of which I cannot be sure that it was a grave, for I was told by one that it was, and by another that it was not—consisted of a mound about breast high in an excavated taro swamp, on the top of which was a child’s house, or rather <hi rend="italic">maniapa</hi>—that is to say, shed, or open house, such as is used in the group for social or political gatherings—so small that only a child could creep under its eaves.  I have heard of another great tomb on Apemama, which I did not see; but here again, by all accounts, no sign of a standing stone.  My report would be—no connection between standing stones and sepulture.  I shall, however, send on the terms of the problem to a highly intelligent resident trader, who knows more than perhaps any one living, white or native, of the Gilbert group; and you shall have the result.  In Samoa, whither I return for good, I shall myself make inquiries; up to now, I have neither seen nor heard of any standing stones in that group.—Yours,</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR MRS. FAIRCHILD,—I began a letter to you on board the <hi rend="italic">Janet Nicoll</hi> on my last cruise, wrote, I believe, two sheets, and ruthlessly destroyed the flippant trash.  Your last has given me great pleasure and some pain, for it increased the consciousness of my neglect.  Now, this must go to you, whatever it is like.</p>
                     <p>. . . You are quite right; our civilisation is a hollow fraud, all the fun of life is lost by it; all it gains is that a larger number of persons can continue to be contemporaneously unhappy on the surface of the globe.  O, unhappy!—there is a big word and a false—continue to be not nearly—by about twenty per cent.—so happy as they might be: that would be nearer the mark.</p>
                     <p>When—observe that word, which I will write again and larger—WHEN you come to see us in Samoa, you will see for yourself a healthy and happy people.</p>
                     <p>You see, you are one of the very few of our friends rich enough to come and see us; and when my house is built, and the road is made, and we have enough fruit planted and poultry and pigs raised, it is undeniable that you must come—must is the word; that is the way in which I speak to ladies.  You and Fairchild, anyway—perhaps my friend Blair—we’ll arrange details in good time.  It will be the salvation of your souls, and make you willing to die.</p>
                     <p>Let me tell you this: In ’74 or 5 there came to stay with my father and mother a certain Mr. Seed, a prime minister or something of New Zealand.  He spotted what my complaint was; told me that I had no business to stay in Europe; that I should find all I cared for, and all that was good for me, in the Navigator Islands; sat up till four in the morning persuading me, demolishing my scruples.  And I resisted: I refused to go so far from my father and mother.  O, it was virtuous, and O, wasn’t it silly!  But my father, who was always my dearest, got to his grave without that pang; and now in 1890, I (or what is left of me) go at last to the Navigator Islands.  God go with us!  It is but a Pisgah sight when all is said; I go there only to grow old and die; but when you come, you will see it is a fair place for the purpose.</p>

                     <p>I wish you to add to the words at the end of the prologue; they run, I think, thus, ‘And this is the yarn of Loudon Dodd’; add, ‘not as he told, but as he wrote it afterwards for his diversion.’  This becomes the more needful, because, when all is done, I shall probably revert to Tai-o-hae, and give final details about the characters in the way of a conversation between Dodd and Havers.  These little snippets of information and <hi rend="italic">faits-divers</hi> have always a disjointed, broken-backed appearance; yet, readers like them.  In this book we have introduced so many characters, that this kind of epilogue will be looked for; and I rather hope, looking far ahead, that I can lighten it in dialogue.</p>
                     <p>We are well past the middle now.  How does it strike you? and can you guess my mystery?  It will make a fattish volume!</p>
                     <p>I say, have you ever read the <hi rend="italic">Highland Widow</hi>?  I never had till yesterday: I am half inclined, bar a trip or two, to think it Scott’s masterpiece; and it has the name of a failure!  Strange things are readers.</p>
                     <p>I expect proofs and revises in duplicate.</p>
                     <p>We have now got into a small barrack at our place.  We see the sea six hundred feet below filling the end of two vales of forest.  On one hand the mountain runs above us some thousand feet higher; great trees stand round us in our clearing; there is an endless voice of birds; I have never lived in such a heaven; just now, I have fever, which mitigates but not destroys my gusto in my circumstances.—You may envy</p>

                     <p>. . . O, I don’t know if I mentioned that having seen your new tail to the magazine, I cried off interference, at least for this trip.  Did I ask you to send me my books and papers, and all the bound volumes of the mag.? <hi rend="italic">quorum pars</hi>.  I might add that were there a good book or so—new—I don’t believe there is—such would be welcome.</p>
                     <p>I desire—I positively begin to awake—to be remembered to Scribner, Low, St. Gaudens, Russell Sullivan.  Well, well, you fellows have the feast of reason and the flow of soul; I have a better-looking place and climate: you should hear the birds on the hill now!  The day has just wound up with a shower; it is still light without, though I write within here at the cheek of a lamp; my wife and an invaluable German are wrestling about bread on the back verandah; and how the birds and the frogs are rattling, and piping, and hailing from the woods!  Here and there a throaty chuckle; here and there, cries like those of jolly children who have lost their way; here and there, the ringing sleigh-bell of the tree frog.  Out and away down below me on the sea it is still raining; it will be wet under foot on schooners, and the house will leak; how well I know that!  Here the showers only patter on the iron roof, and sometimes roar; and within, the lamp burns steady on the tafa-covered walls, with their dusky tartan patterns, and the book-shelves with their thin array of books; and no squall can rout my house or bring my heart into my mouth.—The well-pleased South Sea Islander,</p>

                     <p>[<hi rend="italic">Vailima</hi>, <hi rend="italic">December</hi> 1890.]</p>
                     <p>MY DEAR BURLINGAME,—By some diabolical accident, I have mislaid your last.  What was in it?  I know not, and here I am caught unexpectedly by the American mail, a week earlier than by computation.  The computation, not the mail, is supposed to be in error.  The vols. of <hi rend="italic">Scribner’s</hi> have arrived, and present a noble appearance in my house, which is not a noble structure at present.  But by autumn we hope to be sprawling in our verandah, twelve feet, sir, by eighty-eight in front, and seventy-two on the flank; view of the sea and mountains, sunrise, moonrise, and the German fleet at anchor three miles away in Apia harbour.  I hope some day to offer you a bowl of kava there, or a slice of a pineapple, or some lemonade from my own hedge.  ‘I know a hedge where the lemons grow’—<hi rend="italic">Shakespeare</hi>.  My house at this moment smells of them strong; and the rain, which a while ago roared there, now rings in minute drops upon the iron roof.  I have no <hi rend="italic">Wrecker</hi> for you this mail, other things having engaged me.  I was on the whole rather relieved you did not vote for regular papers, as I feared the traces.  It is my design from time to time to write a paper of a reminiscential (beastly word) description; some of them I could scarce publish from different considerations; but some of them—for instance, my long experience of gambling places—Homburg, Wiesbaden, Baden-Baden, old Monaco, and new Monte Carlo—would make good magazine padding, if I got the stuff handled the right way.  I never could fathom why verse was put in magazines; it has something to do with the making-up, has it not?  I am scribbling a lot just now; if you are taken badly that way, apply to the South Seas.  I could send you some, I believe, anyway, only none of it is thoroughly ripe.  If kept back the volume of ballads, I’ll soon make it a respectable size if this fit continue.  By the next mail you may expect some more <hi rend="italic">Wrecker</hi>, or I shall be displeased.  Probably no more than a chapter, however, for it is a hard one, and I am denuded of my proofs, my collaborator having walked away with them to England; hence some trouble in catching the just note.</p>
                     <p>I am a mere farmer: my talk, which would scarce interest you on Broadway, is all of fuafua and tuitui, and black boys, and planting and weeding, and axes and cutlasses; my hands are covered with blisters and full of thorns; letters are, doubtless, a fine thing, so are beer and skittles, but give me farmering in the tropics for real interest.  Life goes in enchantment; I come home to find I am late for dinner; and when I go to bed at night, I could cry for the weariness of my loins and thighs.  Do not speak to me of vexation, the life brims with it, but with living interest fairly.</p>
                     <p>Christmas I go to Auckland, to meet Tamate, the New Guinea missionary, a man I love.  The rest of my life is a prospect of much rain, much weeding and making of paths, a little letters, and devilish little to eat.—I am, my dear Burlingame, with messages to all whom it may concern, very sincerely yours,</p>
                     <p>Robert Louis Stevenson.</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR HENRY JAMES,—It is terrible how little everybody writes, and how much of that little disappears in the capacious maw of the Post Office.  Many letters, both from and to me, I now know to have been lost in transit: my eye is on the Sydney Post Office, a large ungainly structure with a tower, as being not a hundred miles from the scene of disappearance; but then I have no proof.  <hi rend="italic">The Tragic Muse</hi> you announced to me as coming; I had already ordered it from a Sydney bookseller: about two months ago he advised me that his copy was in the post; and I am still tragically museless.</p>
                     <p>News, news, news.  What do we know of yours?  What do you care for ours?  We are in the midst of the rainy season, and dwell among alarms of hurricanes, in a very unsafe little two-storied wooden box 650 feet above and about three miles from the sea-beach.  Behind us, till the other slope of the island, desert forest, peaks, and loud torrents; in front green slopes to the sea, some fifty miles of which we dominate.  We see the ships as they go out and in to the dangerous roadstead of Apia; and if they lie far out, we can even see their topmasts while they are at anchor.  Of sounds of men, beyond those of our own labourers, there reach us, at very long intervals, salutes from the warships in harbour, the bell of the cathedral church, and the low of the conch-shell calling the labour boys on the German plantations.  Yesterday, which was Sunday—the <hi rend="italic">quantième</hi> is most likely erroneous; you can now correct it—we had a visitor—Baker of Tonga.  Heard you ever of him?  He is a great man here: he is accused of theft, rape, judicial murder, private poisoning, abortion, misappropriation of public moneys—oddly enough, not forgery, nor arson: you would be amused if you knew how thick the accusations fly in this South Sea world.  I make no doubt my own character is something illustrious; or if not yet, there is a good time coming.</p>
                     <p>But all our resources have not of late been Pacific.  We have had enlightened society: La Farge the painter, and your friend Henry Adams: a great privilege—would it might endure.  I would go oftener to see them, but the place is awkward to reach on horseback.  I had to swim my horse the last time I went to dinner; and as I have not yet returned the clothes I had to borrow, I dare not return in the same plight: it seems inevitable—as soon as the wash comes in, I plump straight into the American consul’s shirt or trousers!  They, I believe, would come oftener to see me but for the horrid doubt that weighs upon our commissariat department; we have <hi rend="italic">often</hi> almost nothing to eat; a guest would simply break the bank; my wife and I have dined on one avocado pear; I have several times dined on hard bread and onions.  What would you do with a guest at such narrow seasons?—eat him? or serve up a labour boy fricasseed?</p>
                     <p>Work? work is now arrested, but I have written, I should think, about thirty chapters of the South Sea book; they will all want rehandling, I dare say.  Gracious, what a strain is a long book!  The time it took me to design this volume, before I could dream of putting pen to paper, was excessive; and then think of writing a book of travels on the spot, when I am continually extending my information, revising my opinions, and seeing the most finely finished portions of my work come part by part in pieces.  Very soon I shall have no opinions left.  And without an opinion, how to string artistically vast accumulations of fact?  Darwin said no one could observe without a theory; I suppose he was right; ’tis a fine point of metaphysic; but I will take my oath, no man can write without one—at least the way he would like to, and my theories melt, melt, melt, and as they melt the thaw-waters wash down my writing, and leave unideal tracts—wastes instead of cultivated farms.</p>
                     <p>Kipling is by far the most promising young man who has appeared since—ahem—I appeared.  He amazes me by his precocity and various endowment.  But he alarms me by his copiousness and haste.  He should shield his fire with both hands ‘and draw up all his strength and sweetness in one ball.’  (‘Draw all his strength and all His sweetness up into one ball’?  I cannot remember Marvell’s words.)  So the critics have been saying to me; but I was never capable of—and surely never guilty of—such a debauch of production.  At this rate his works will soon fill the habitable globe; and surely he was armed for better conflicts than these succinct sketches and flying leaves of verse?  I look on, I admire, I rejoice for myself; but in a kind of ambition we all have for our tongue and literature I am wounded.  If I had this man’s fertility and courage, it seems to me I could heave a pyramid.</p>
                     <p>Well, we begin to be the old fogies now; and it was high time <hi rend="italic">something</hi> rose to take our places.  Certainly Kipling has the gifts; the fairy godmothers were all tipsy at his christening: what will he do with them?</p>
                     <p>Goodbye, my dear James; find an hour to write to us, and register your letter.—Yours affectionately,</p>

                     <p>SIR,—I cannot call to mind having written you, but I am so throng with occupation this may have fallen aside.  I never heard tell I had any friends in Ireland, and I am led to understand you are come of no considerable family.  The gentleman I now serve with assures me, however, you are a very pretty fellow and your letter deserves to be remarked.  It’s true he is himself a man of a very low descent upon the one side; though upon the other he counts cousinship with a gentleman, my very good friend, the late Mr. Balfour of the Shaws, in the Lothian; which I should be wanting in good fellowship to forget.  He tells me besides you are a man of your hands; I am not informed of your weapon; but if all be true it sticks in my mind I would be ready to make exception in your favour, and meet you like one gentleman with another.  I suppose this’ll be your purpose in your favour, which I could very ill make out; it’s one I would be sweir to baulk you of.  It seems, Mr. McIlvaine, which I take to be your name, you are in the household of a gentleman of the name of Coupling: for whom my friend is very much engaged.  The distances being very uncommodious, I think it will be maybe better if we leave it to these two to settle all that’s necessary to honour.  I would have you to take heed it’s a very unusual condescension on my part, that bear a King’s name; and for the matter of that I think shame to be mingled with a person of the name of Coupling, which is doubtless a very good house but one I never heard tell of, any more than Stevenson.  But your purpose being laudable, I would be sorry (as the word goes) to cut off my nose to spite my face.—I am, Sir, your humble servant,</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR SIR,—<hi rend="italic">Sapristi</hi>, <hi rend="italic">comme vous y allez</hi>!  Richard III. and Dumas, with all my heart; but not Hamlet.  Hamlet is great literature; Richard III. a big, black, gross, sprawling melodrama, writ with infinite spirit but with no refinement or philosophy by a man who had the world, himself, mankind, and his trade still to learn.  I prefer the Vicomte de Bragelonne to Richard III.; it is better done of its kind: I simply do not mention the Vicomte in the same part of the building with Hamlet, or Lear, or Othello, or any of those masterpieces that Shakespeare survived to give us.</p>
                     <p>Also, <hi rend="italic">comme vous y allez</hi> in my commendation!  I fear my <hi rend="italic">solide éducation classique</hi> had best be described, like Shakespeare’s, as ‘little Latin and no Greek,’ and I was educated, let me inform you, for an engineer.  I shall tell my bookseller to send you a copy of <hi rend="italic">Memories and Portraits</hi>, where you will see something of my descent and education, as it was, and hear me at length on my dear Vicomte.  I give you permission gladly to take your choice out of my works, and translate what you shall prefer, too much honoured that so clever a young man should think it worth the pains.  My own choice would lie between <hi rend="italic">Kidnapped</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Master of Ballantrae</hi>.  Should you choose the latter, pray do not let Mrs. Henry thrust the sword up to the hilt in the frozen ground—one of my inconceivable blunders, an exaggeration to stagger Hugo.  Say ‘she sought to thrust it in the ground.’  In both these works you should be prepared for Scotticisms used deliberately.</p>
                     <p>I fear my stepson will not have found time to get to Paris; he was overwhelmed with occupation, and is already on his voyage back.  We live here in a beautiful land, amid a beautiful and interesting people.  The life is still very hard: my wife and I live in a two-roomed cottage, about three miles and six hundred and fifty feet above the sea; we have had to make the road to it; our supplies are very imperfect; in the wild weather of this (the hurricane) season we have much discomfort: one night the wind blew in our house so outrageously that we must sit in the dark; and as the sound of the rain on the roof made speech inaudible, you may imagine we found the evening long.  All these things, however, are pleasant to me.  You say <hi rend="italic">l’artiste inconscient</hi> set off to travel: you do not divide me right.  0.6 of me is artist; 0.4, adventurer.  First, I suppose, come letters; then adventure; and since I have indulged the second part, I think the formula begins to change: 0.55 of an artist, 0.45 of the adventurer were nearer true.  And if it had not been for my small strength, I might have been a different man in all things.</p>
                     <p>Whatever you do, do not neglect to send me what you publish on Villon: I look forward to that with lively interest.  I have no photograph at hand, but I will send one when I can.  It would be kind if you would do the like, for I do not see much chance of our meeting in the flesh: and a name, and a handwriting, and an address, and even a style?  I know about as much of Tacitus, and more of Horace; it is not enough between contemporaries, such as we still are.  I have just remembered another of my books, which I re-read the other day, and thought in places good—<hi rend="italic">Prince Otto</hi>.  It is not as good as either of the others; but it has one recommendation—it has female parts, so it might perhaps please better in France.</p>
                     <p>I will ask Chatto to send you, then—<hi rend="italic">Prince Otto</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Memories and Portraits</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Underwoods</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Ballads</hi>, none of which you seem to have seen.  They will be too late for the New Year: let them be an Easter present.</p>
                     <p>You must translate me soon; you will soon have better to do than to transverse the work of others.—Yours very truly,</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR BAILDON,—This is a real disappointment.  It was so long since we had met, I was anxious to see where time had carried and stranded us.  Last time we saw each other—it must have been all ten years ago, as we were new to the thirties—it was only for a moment, and now we’re in the forties, and before very long we shall be in our graves.  Sick and well, I have had a splendid life of it, grudge nothing, regret very little—and then only some little corners of misconduct for which I deserve hanging, and must infallibly be damned—and, take it all over, damnation and all, would hardly change with any man of my time, unless perhaps it were Gordon or our friend Chalmers: a man I admire for his virtues, love for his faults, and envy for the really A1 life he has, with everything heart—my heart, I mean—could wish.  It is curious to think you will read this in the grey metropolis; go the first grey, east-windy day into the Caledonian Station, if it looks at all as it did of yore: I met Satan there.  And then go and stand by the cross, and remember the other one—him that went down—my brother, Robert Fergusson.  It is a pity you had not made me out, and seen me as patriarch and planter.  I shall look forward to some record of your time with Chalmers: you can’t weary me of that fellow, he is as big as a house and far bigger than any church, where no man warms his hands.  Do you know anything of Thomson?  Of A—, B—, C—, D—, E—, F—, at all?  As I write C.’s name mustard rises my nose; I have never forgiven that weak, amiable boy a little trick he played me when I could ill afford it: I mean that whenever I think of it, some of the old wrath kindles, not that I would hurt the poor soul, if I got the world with it.  And Old X—?  Is he still afloat?  Harmless bark!  I gather you ain’t married yet, since your sister, to whom I ask to be remembered, goes with you.  Did you see a silly tale, <hi rend="italic">John Nicholson’s Predicament</hi>, <ref target="#6855990405419608431_637-h-3.htm.xhtml#footnote220">[220]</ref> or some such name, in which I made free with your home at Murrayfield?  There is precious little sense in it, but it might amuse.  Cassell’s published it in a thing called <hi rend="italic">Yule-Tide</hi> years ago, and nobody that ever I heard of read or has ever seen <hi rend="italic">Yule-Tide</hi>.  It is addressed to a class we never met—readers of Cassell’s series and that class of conscientious chaff, and my tale was dull, though I don’t recall that it was conscientious.  Only, there’s the house at Murrayfield and a dead body in it.  Glad the <hi rend="italic">Ballads</hi> amused you.  They failed to entertain a coy public, at which I wondered, not that I set much account by my verses, which are the verses of Prosator; but I do know how to tell a yarn, and two of the yarns are great.  <hi rend="italic">Rahero</hi> is for its length a perfect folk-tale: savage and yet fine, full of tailforemost morality, ancient as the granite rocks; if the historian, not to say the politician, could get that yarn into his head, he would have learned some of his A B C. But the average man at home cannot understand antiquity; he is sunk over the ears in Roman civilisation; and a tale like that of <hi rend="italic">Rahero</hi> falls on his ears inarticulate.  The <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi> said there was no psychology in it; that interested me much: my grandmother (as I used to call that able paper, and an able paper it is, and a fair one) cannot so much as observe the existence of savage psychology when it is put before it.  I am at bottom a psychologist and ashamed of it; the tale seized me one-third because of its picturesque features, two-thirds because of its astonishing psychology, and the <hi rend="italic">Spectator</hi> says there’s none.  I am going on with a lot of island work, exulting in the knowledge of a new world, ‘a new created world’ and new men; and I am sure my income will DECLINE and FALL off; for the effort of comprehension is death to the intelligent public, and sickness to the dull.</p>
                     <p>I do not know why I pester you with all this trash, above all as you deserve nothing.  I give you my warm <hi rend="italic">talofa</hi> (‘my love to you,’ Samoan salutation).  Write me again when the spirit moves you.  And some day, if I still live, make out the trip again and let us hob-a-nob with our grey pows on my verandah.—Yours sincerely,</p>

                     <p>DEAR MR. ANGUS,—Surely I remember you!  It was W. C. Murray who made us acquainted, and we had a pleasant crack.  I see your poet is not yet dead.  I remember even our talk—or you would not think of trusting that invaluable <hi rend="italic">Jolly Beggars</hi> to the treacherous posts, and the perils of the sea, and the carelessness of authors.  I love the idea, but I could not bear the risk.  However—</p>
                     <p>‘Hale be your heart, hale be your fiddle—’</p>
                     <p>it was kindly thought upon.</p>
                     <p>My interest in Burns is, as you suppose, perennial.  I would I could be present at the exhibition, with the purpose of which I heartily sympathise; but the <hi rend="italic">Nancy</hi> has not waited in vain for me, I have followed my chest, the anchor is weighed long ago, I have said my last farewell to the hills and the heather and the lynns: like Leyden, I have gone into far lands to die, not stayed like Burns to mingle in the end with Scottish soil.  I shall not even return like Scott for the last scene.  Burns Exhibitions are all over.  ’Tis a far cry to Lochow from tropical Vailima.</p>
                     <p>‘But still our hearts are true, our hearts are Highland,<lb/>And we in dreams behold the Hebrides.’</p>
                     <p>When your hand is in, will you remember our poor Edinburgh Robin?  Burns alone has been just to his promise; follow Burns, he knew best, he knew whence he drew fire—from the poor, white-faced, drunken, vicious boy that raved himself to death in the Edinburgh madhouse.  Surely there is more to be gleaned about Fergusson, and surely it is high time the task was set about.  I may tell you (because your poet is not dead) something of how I feel: we are three Robins who have touched the Scots lyre this last century.  Well, the one is the world’s, he did it, he came off, he is for ever; but I and the other—ah! what bonds we have—born in the same city; both sickly, both pestered, one nearly to madness, one to the madhouse, with a damnatory creed; both seeing the stars and the dawn, and wearing shoe-leather on the same ancient stones, under the same pends, down the same closes, where our common ancestors clashed in their armour, rusty or bright.  And the old Robin, who was before Burns and the flood, died in his acute, painful youth, and left the models of the great things that were to come; and the new, who came after, outlived his greensickness, and has faintly tried to parody the finished work.  If you will collect the strays of Robin Fergusson, fish for material, collect any last re-echoing of gossip, command me to do what you prefer—to write the preface—to write the whole if you prefer: anything, so that another monument (after Burns’s) be set up to my unhappy predecessor on the causey of Auld Reekie.  You will never know, nor will any man, how deep this feeling is: I believe Fergusson lives in me.  I do, but tell it not in Gath; every man has these fanciful superstitions, coming, going, but yet enduring; only most men are so wise (or the poet in them so dead) that they keep their follies for themselves.—I am, yours very truly,</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR GOSSE,—I have to thank you and Mrs. Gosse for many mementoes, chiefly for your <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> of your father.  There is a very delicate task, very delicately done.  I noted one or two carelessnesses, which I meant to point out to you for another edition; but I find I lack the time, and you will remark them for yourself against a new edition.  They were two, or perhaps three, flabbinesses of style which (in your work) amazed me.  Am I right in thinking you were a shade bored over the last chapters? or was it my own fault that made me think them susceptible of a more athletic compression?  (The flabbinesses were not there, I think, but in the more admirable part, where they showed the bigger.)  Take it all together, the book struck me as if you had been hurried at the last, but particularly hurried over the proofs, and could still spend a very profitable fortnight in earnest revision and (towards the end) heroic compression.  The book, in design, subject, and general execution, is well worth the extra trouble.  And even if I were wrong in thinking it specially wanted, it will not be lost; for do we not know, in Flaubert’s dread confession, that ‘prose is never done’?  What a medium to work in, for a man tired, perplexed among different aims and subjects, and spurred by the immediate need of ‘siller’!  However, it’s mine for what it’s worth; and it’s one of yours, the devil take it; and you know, as well as Flaubert, and as well as me, that it is <hi rend="italic">never done</hi>; in other words, it is a torment of the pit, usually neglected by the bards who (lucky beggars!) approached the Styx in measure.  I speak bitterly at the moment, having just detected in myself the last fatal symptom, three blank verses in succession—and I believe, God help me, a hemistich at the tail of them; hence I have deposed the labourer, come out of hell by my private trap, and now write to you from my little place in purgatory.  But I prefer hell: would I could always dig in those red coals—or else be at sea in a schooner, bound for isles unvisited: to be on shore and not to work is emptiness—suicidal vacancy.</p>
                     <p>I was the more interested in your <hi rend="italic">Life</hi> of your father, because I meditate one of mine, or rather of my family.  I have no such materials as you, and (our objections already made) your attack fills me with despair; it is direct and elegant, and your style is always admirable to me—lenity, lucidity, usually a high strain of breeding, an elegance that has a pleasant air of the accidental.  But beware of purple passages.  I wonder if you think as well of your purple passages as I do of mine?  I wonder if you think as ill of mine as I do of yours?  I wonder; I can tell you at least what is wrong with yours—they are treated in the spirit of verse.  The spirit—I don’t mean the measure, I don’t mean you fall into bastard cadences; what I mean is that they seem vacant and smoothed out, ironed, if you like.  And in a style which (like yours) aims more and more successfully at the academic, one purple word is already much; three—a whole phrase—is inadmissible.  Wed yourself to a clean austerity: that is your force.  Wear a linen ephod, splendidly candid.  Arrange its folds, but do not fasten it with any brooch.  I swear to you, in your talking robes, there should be no patch of adornment; and where the subject forces, let it force you no further than it must; and be ready with a twinkle of your pleasantry.  Yours is a fine tool, and I see so well how to hold it; I wonder if you see how to hold mine?  But then I am to the neck in prose, and just now in the ‘dark <hi rend="italic">interstylar</hi> cave,’ all methods and effects wooing me, myself in the midst impotent to follow any.  I look for dawn presently, and a full flowing river of expression, running whither it wills.  But these useless seasons, above all, when a man <hi rend="italic">must</hi> continue to spoil paper, are infinitely weary.</p>
                     <p>We are in our house after a fashion; without furniture, ’tis true, camping there, like the family after a sale.  But the bailiff has not yet appeared; he will probably come after.  The place is beautiful beyond dreams; some fifty miles of the Pacific spread in front; deep woods all round; a mountain making in the sky a profile of huge trees upon our left; about us, the little island of our clearing, studded with brave old gentlemen (or ladies, or ‘the twa o’ them’) whom we have spared.  It is a good place to be in; night and morning, we have Theodore Rousseaus (always a new one) hung to amuse us on the walls of the world; and the moon—this is our good season, we have a moon just now—makes the night a piece of heaven.  It amazes me how people can live on in the dirty north; yet if you saw our rainy season (which is really a caulker for wind, wet, and darkness—howling showers, roaring winds, pit-blackness at noon) you might marvel how we could endure that.  And we can’t.  But there’s a winter everywhere; only ours is in the summer.  Mark my words: there will be a winter in heaven—and in hell.  <hi rend="italic">Cela rentre dans les procédés du bon Dieu</hi>; <hi rend="italic">et vous verrez</hi>!  There’s another very good thing about Vailima, I am away from the little bubble of the literary life.  It is not all beer and skittles, is it?  By the by, my <hi rend="italic">Ballads</hi> seem to have been dam bad; all the crickets sing so in their crickety papers; and I have no ghost of an idea on the point myself: verse is always to me the unknowable.  You might tell me how it strikes a professional bard: not that it really matters, for, of course, good or bad, I don’t think I shall get into <hi rend="italic">that</hi> galley any more.  But I should like to know if you join the shrill chorus of the crickets.  The crickets are the devil in all to you: ’tis a strange thing, they seem to rejoice like a strong man in their injustice.  I trust you got my letter about your Browning book.  In case it missed, I wish to say again that your publication of Browning’s kind letter, as an illustration of <hi rend="italic">his</hi> character, was modest, proper, and in radiant good taste.—In Witness whereof, etc., etc.,</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR MAY,—I never think of you by any more ceremonial name, so I will not pretend.  There is not much chance that I shall forget you until the time comes for me to forget all this little turmoil in a corner (though indeed I have been in several corners) of an inconsiderable planet.  You remain in my mind for a good reason, having given me (in so short a time) the most delightful pleasure.  I shall remember, and you must still be beautiful.  The truth is, you must grow more so, or you will soon be less.  It is not so easy to be a flower, even when you bear a flower’s name.  And if I admired you so much, and still remember you, it is not because of your face, but because you were then worthy of it, as you must still continue.</p>
                     <p>Will you give my heartiest congratulations to Mr. S.?  He has my admiration; he is a brave man; when I was young, I should have run away from the sight of you, pierced with the sense of my unfitness.  He is more wise and manly.  What a good husband he will have to be!  And you—what a good wife!  Carry your love tenderly.  I will never forgive him—or you—it is in both your hands—if the face that once gladdened my heart should be changed into one sour or sorrowful.</p>
                     <p>What a person you are to give flowers!  It was so I first heard of you; and now you are giving the May flower!</p>
                     <p>Yes, Skerryvore has passed; it was, for us.  But I wish you could see us in our new home on the mountain, in the middle of great woods, and looking far out over the Pacific.  When Mr. S. is very rich, he must bring you round the world and let you see it, and see the old gentleman and the old lady.  I mean to live quite a long while yet, and my wife must do the same, or else I couldn’t manage it; so, you see, you will have plenty of time; and it’s a pity not to see the most beautiful places, and the most beautiful people moving there, and the real stars and moon overhead, instead of the tin imitations that preside over London.  I do not think my wife very well; but I am in hopes she will now have a little rest.  It has been a hard business, above all for her; we lived four months in the hurricane season in a miserable house, overborne with work, ill-fed, continually worried, drowned in perpetual rain, beaten upon by wind, so that we must sit in the dark in the evenings; and then I ran away, and she had a month of it alone.  Things go better now; the back of the work is broken; and we are still foolish enough to look forward to a little peace.  I am a very different person from the prisoner of Skerryvore.  The other day I was three-and-twenty hours in an open boat; it made me pretty ill; but fancy its not killing me half-way!  It is like a fairy story that I should have recovered liberty and strength, and should go round again among my fellow-men, boating, riding, bathing, toiling hard with a wood-knife in the forest.  I can wish you nothing more delightful than my fortune in life; I wish it you; and better, if the thing be possible.</p>
                     <p>Lloyd is tinkling below me on the typewriter; my wife has just left the room; she asks me to say she would have written had she been well enough, and hopes to do it still.—Accept the best wishes of your admirer,</p>
                     <p>Robert Louis Stevenson.</p>

                     <p>[<hi rend="italic">Vailima</hi>, <hi rend="italic">May</hi> 1891.]</p>
                     <p>MY DEAR ADELAIDE,—I will own you just did manage to tread on my gouty toe; and I beg to assure you with most people I should simply have turned away and said no more.  My cudgelling was therefore in the nature of a caress or testimonial.</p>
                     <p>God forbid, I should seem to judge for you on such a point; it was what you seemed to set forth as your reasons that fluttered my old Presbyterian spirit—for, mind you, I am a child of the Covenanters—whom I do not love, but they are mine after all, my father’s and my mother’s—and they had their merits too, and their ugly beauties, and grotesque heroisms, that I love them for, the while I laugh at them; but in their name and mine do what you think right, and let the world fall.  That is the privilege and the duty of private persons; and I shall think the more of you at the greater distance, because you keep a promise to your fellow-man, your helper and creditor in life, by just so much as I was tempted to think the less of you (O not much, or I would never have been angry) when I thought you were the swallower of a (tinfoil) formula.</p>
                     <p>I must say I was uneasy about my letter, not because it was too strong as an expression of my unregenerate sentiments, but because I knew full well it should be followed by something kinder.  And the mischief has been in my health.  I fell sharply sick in Sydney, was put aboard the <hi rend="italic">Lübeck</hi> pretty bad, got to Vailima, hung on a month there, and didn’t pick up as well as my work needed; set off on a journey, gained a great deal, lost it again; and am back at Vailima, still no good at my necessary work.  I tell you this for my imperfect excuse that I should not have written you again sooner to remove the bad taste of my last.</p>
                     <p>A road has been called Adelaide Road; it leads from the back of our house to the bridge, and thence to the garden, and by a bifurcation to the pig pen.  It is thus much traversed, particularly by Fanny.  An oleander, the only one of your seeds that prospered in this climate, grows there; and the name is now some week or ten days applied and published.  Adelaide Road leads also into the bush, to the banana patch, and by a second bifurcation over the left branch of the stream to the plateau and the right hand of the gorges.  In short, it leads to all sorts of good, and is, besides, in itself a pretty winding path, bound downhill among big woods to the margin of the stream.</p>
                     <p>What a strange idea, to think me a Jew-hater!  Isaiah and David and Heine are good enough for me; and I leave more unsaid.  Were I of Jew blood, I do not think I could ever forgive the Christians; the ghettos would get in my nostrils like mustard or lit gunpowder.  Just so you as being a child of the Presbytery, I retain—I need not dwell on that.  The ascendant hand is what I feel most strongly; I am bound in and in with my forbears; were he one of mine, I should not be struck at all by Mr. Moss of Bevis Marks, I should still see behind him Moses of the Mount and the Tables and the shining face.  We are all nobly born; fortunate those who know it; blessed those who remember.</p>
                     <p>I am, my dear Adelaide, most genuinely yours,</p>
                     <p>Robert Louis Stevenson.</p>
                     <p>Write by return to say you are better, and I will try to do the same.</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR CHARLES,—I don’t know what you think of me, not having written to you at all during your illness.  I find two sheets begun with your name, but that is no excuse. . . . I am keeping bravely; getting about better, every day, and hope soon to be in my usual fettle.  My books begin to come; and I fell once more on the Old Bailey session papers.  I have 1778, 1784, and 1786.  Should you be able to lay hands on any other volumes, above all a little later, I should be very glad you should buy them for me.  I particularly want <hi rend="italic">one</hi> or <hi rend="italic">two</hi> during the course of the Peninsular War.  Come to think, I ought rather to have communicated this want to Bain.  Would it bore you to communicate to that effect with the great man?  The sooner I have them, the better for me.  ’Tis for Henry Shovel.  But Henry Shovel has now turned into a work called ‘The Shovels of Newton French: Including Memoirs of Henry Shovel, a Private in the Peninsular War,’ which work is to begin in 1664 with the marriage of Skipper, afterwards Alderman Shovel of Bristol, Henry’s great-great-grandfather, and end about 1832 with his own second marriage to the daughter of his runaway aunt.  Will the public ever stand such an opus?  Gude kens, but it tickles me.  Two or three historical personages will just appear: Judge Jeffreys, Wellington, Colquhoun, Grant, and I think Townsend the runner.  I know the public won’t like it; let ’em lump it then; I mean to make it good; it will be more like a saga.—Adieu, yours ever affectionately,</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR BURLINGAME,—I find among my grandfather’s papers his own reminiscences of his voyage round the north with Sir Walter, eighty years ago, <hi rend="italic">labuntur anni</hi>!  They are not remarkably good, but he was not a bad observer, and several touches seem to me speaking.  It has occurred to me you might like them to appear in the <hi rend="italic">Magazine</hi>.  If you would, kindly let me know, and tell me how you would like it handled.  My grandad’s MS. runs to between six and seven thousand words, which I could abbreviate of anecdotes that scarce touch Sir W.  Would you like this done?  Would you like me to introduce the old gentleman?  I had something of the sort in my mind, and could fill a few columns rather <hi rend="italic">à propos</hi>.  I give you the first offer of this, according to your request; for though it may forestall one of the interests of my biography, the thing seems to me particularly suited for prior appearance in a magazine.</p>
                     <p>I see the first number of the <hi rend="italic">Wrecker</hi>; I thought it went lively enough; and by a singular accident, the picture is not unlike Tai-o-hae!</p>
                     <p>Thus we see the age of miracles, etc.—Yours very sincerely,</p>

                     <p>DEAR MR. ANGUS,—You can use my letter as you will.  The parcel has not come; pray Heaven the next post bring it safe.  Is it possible for me to write a preface here?  I will try if you like, if you think I must: though surely there are Rivers in Assyria.  Of course you will send me sheets of the catalogue; I suppose it (the preface) need not be long; perhaps it should be rather very short?  Be sure you give me your views upon these points.  Also tell me what names to mention among those of your helpers, and do remember to register everything, else it is not safe.</p>
                     <p>The true place (in my view) for a monument to Fergusson were the churchyard of Haddington.  But as that would perhaps not carry many votes, I should say one of the two following sites:—First, either as near the site of the old Bedlam as we could get, or, second, beside the Cross, the heart of his city.  Upon this I would have a fluttering butterfly, and, I suggest, the citation,</p>
                     <p>Poor butterfly, thy case I mourn.</p>
                     <p>For the case of Fergusson is not one to pretend about.  A more miserable tragedy the sun never shone upon, or (in consideration of our climate) I should rather say refused to brighten.—Yours truly,</p>
                     <p>Robert Louis Stevenson.</p>
                     <p>Where Burns goes will not matter.  He is no local poet, like your Robin the First; he is general as the casing air.  Glasgow, as the chief city of Scottish men, would do well; but for God’s sake, don’t let it be like the Glasgow memorial to Knox: I remember, when I first saw this, laughing for an hour by Shrewsbury clock.</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR HENRY JAMES,—From this perturbed and hunted being expect but a line, and that line shall be but a whoop for Adela.  O she’s delicious, delicious; I could live and die with Adela—die, rather the better of the two; you never did a straighter thing, and never will.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">David Balfour</hi>, second part of <hi rend="italic">Kidnapped</hi>, is on the stocks at last; and is not bad, I think.  As for <hi rend="italic">The Wrecker</hi>, it’s a machine, you know—don’t expect aught else—a machine, and a police machine; but I believe the end is one of the most genuine butcheries in literature; and we point to our machine with a modest pride, as the only police machine without a villain.  Our criminals are a most pleasing crew, and leave the dock with scarce a stain upon their character.</p>
                     <p>What a different line of country to be trying to draw Adela, and trying to write the last four chapters of <hi rend="italic">The Wrecker</hi>!  Heavens, it’s like two centuries; and ours is such rude, transpontine business, aiming only at a certain fervour of conviction and sense of energy and violence in the men; and yours is so neat and bright and of so exquisite a surface!  Seems dreadful to send such a book to such an author; but your name is on the list.  And we do modestly ask you to consider the chapters on the <hi rend="italic">Norah Creina</hi> with the study of Captain Nares, and the forementioned last four, with their brutality of substance and the curious (and perhaps unsound) technical manœuvre of running the story together to a point as we go along, the narrative becoming more succinct and the details fining off with every page.—Sworn affidavit of</p>

                     <p>Adela, Adela, Adela Chart,<lb/>What have you done to my elderly heart?<lb/>Of all the ladies of paper and ink<lb/>I count you the paragon, call you the pink.<lb/>The word of your brother depicts you in part:<lb/>‘You raving maniac!’ Adela Chart;<lb/>But in all the asylums that cumber the ground,<lb/>So delightful a maniac was ne’er to be found.</p>
                     <p>I pore on you, dote on you, clasp you to heart,<lb/>I laud, love, and laugh at you, Adela Chart,<lb/>And thank my dear maker the while I admire<lb/>That I can be neither your husband nor sire.</p>
                     <p>Your husband’s, your sire’s were a difficult part;<lb/>You’re a byway to suicide, Adela Chart;<lb/>But to read of, depicted by exquisite James,<lb/>O, sure you’re the flower and quintessence of dames.</p>

                     <p>My heart was inditing a goodly matter about Adela Chart.</p>
                     <p>Though oft I’ve been touched by the volatile dart,<lb/>To none have I grovelled but Adela Chart,<lb/>There are passable ladies, no question, in art—<lb/>But where is the marrow of Adela Chart?<lb/>I dreamed that to Tyburn I passed in the cart—<lb/>I dreamed I was married to Adela Chart:<lb/>From the first I awoke with a palpable start,<lb/>The second dumfoundered me, Adela Chart!</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR BURLINGAME,—All right, you shall have the <hi rend="italic">Tales of my Grandfather</hi> soon, but I guess we’ll try and finish off <hi rend="italic">The Wrecker</hi> first.  <hi rend="italic">À propos</hi> of whom, please send some advanced sheets to Cassell’s—away ahead of you—so that they may get a dummy out.</p>
                     <p>Do you wish to illustrate <hi rend="italic">My Grandfather</hi>?  He mentions as excellent a portrait of Scott by Basil Hall’s brother.  I don’t think I ever saw this engraved; would it not, if you could get track of it, prove a taking embellishment?  I suggest this for your consideration and inquiry.  A new portrait of Scott strikes me as good.  There is a hard, tough, constipated old portrait of my grandfather hanging in my aunt’s house, Mrs. Alan Stevenson, 16 St. Leonard’s Terrace, Chelsea, which has never been engraved—the better portrait, Joseph’s bust has been reproduced, I believe, twice—and which, I am sure, my aunt would let you have a copy of.  The plate could be of use for the book when we get so far, and thus to place it in the <hi rend="italic">Magazine</hi> might be an actual saving.</p>
                     <p>I am swallowed up in politics for the first, I hope for the last, time in my sublunary career.  It is a painful, thankless trade; but one thing that came up I could not pass in silence.  Much drafting, addressing, deputationising has eaten up all my time, and again (to my contrition) I leave you Wreckerless.  As soon as the mail leaves I tackle it straight.—Yours very sincerely,</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR BURLINGAME,—The time draws nigh, the mail is near due, and I snatch a moment of collapse so that you may have at least some sort of a scratch of note along with the</p>

                     <p>Hurray!</p>
                     <p>which I mean to go herewith.  It has taken me a devil of a pull, but I think it’s going to be ready.  If I did not know you were on the stretch waiting for it and trembling for your illustrations, I would keep it for another finish; but things being as they are, I will let it go the best way I can get it.  I am now within two pages of the end of Chapter XXV., which is the last chapter, the end with its gathering up of loose threads, being the dedication to Low, and addressed to him: this is my last and best expedient for the knotting up of these loose cards.  ’Tis possible I may not get that finished in time, in which case you’ll receive only Chapters XXII. to XXV. by this mail, which is all that can be required for illustration.</p>
                     <p>I wish you would send me <hi rend="italic">Memoirs of Baron Marbot</hi> (French); <hi rend="italic">Introduction to the Study of the History of Language</hi>, Strong, Logeman &amp; Wheeler; <hi rend="italic">Principles of Psychology</hi>, William James; Morris &amp; Magnusson’s <hi rend="italic">Saga Library</hi>, any volumes that are out; George Meredith’s <hi rend="italic">One of our Conquerors</hi>; <hi rend="italic">Là Bas</hi>, by Huysmans (French); O’Connor Morris’s <hi rend="italic">Great Commanders of Modern Times</hi>; <hi rend="italic">Life’s Handicap</hi>, by Kipling; of Taine’s <hi rend="italic">Origines de la France Contemporaine</hi>, I have only as far as <hi rend="italic">la Révolution</hi>, vol. iii.; if another volume is out, please add that.  There is for a book-box.</p>
                     <p>I hope you will like the end; I think it is rather strong meat.  I have got into such a deliberate, dilatory, expansive turn, that the effort to compress this last yarn was unwelcome; but the longest yarn has to come to an end sometime.  Please look it over for carelessnesses, and tell me if it had any effect upon your jaded editorial mind.  I’ll see if ever I have time to add more.</p>
                     <p>I add to my book-box list Adams’ <hi rend="italic">Historical Essays</hi>; the Plays of A. W. Pinero—all that have appeared, and send me the rest in course as they do appear; <hi rend="italic">Noughts and Crosses</hi> by Q.; Robertson’s <hi rend="italic">Scotland under her Early Kings</hi>.</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR MR. ANGUS,—Herewith the invaluable sheets.  They came months after your letter, and I trembled; but here they are, and I have scrawled my vile name on them, and ‘thocht shame’ as I did it.  I am expecting the sheets of your catalogue, so that I may attack the preface.  Please give me all the time you can.  The sooner the better; you might even send me early proofs as they are sent out, to give me more incubation.  I used to write as slow as judgment; now I write rather fast; but I am still ‘a slow study,’ and sit a long while silent on my eggs.  Unconscious thought, there is the only method: macerate your subject, let it boil slow, then take the lid off and look in—and there your stuff is, good or bad.  But the journalist’s method is the way to manufacture lies; it is will-worship—if you know the luminous quaker phrase; and the will is only to be brought in the field for study, and again for revision.  The essential part of work is not an act, it is a state.</p>
                     <p>I do not know why I write you this trash.</p>
                     <p>Many thanks for your handsome dedication.  I have not yet had time to do more than glance at Mrs. Begg; it looks interesting.—Yours very truly,</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR LOUISA,—Your picture of the church, the photograph of yourself and your sister, and your very witty and pleasing letter, came all in a bundle, and made me feel I had my money’s worth for that birthday.  I am now, I must be, one of your nearest relatives; exactly what we are to each other, I do not know, I doubt if the case has ever happened before—your papa ought to know, and I don’t believe he does; but I think I ought to call you in the meanwhile, and until we get the advice of counsel learned in the law, my name-daughter.  Well, I was extremely pleased to see by the church that my name-daughter could draw; by the letter, that she was no fool; and by the photograph, that she was a pretty girl, which hurts nothing.  See how virtues are rewarded!  My first idea of adopting you was entirely charitable; and here I find that I am quite proud of it, and of you, and that I chose just the kind of name-daughter I wanted.  For I can draw too, or rather I mean to say I could before I forgot how; and I am very far from being a fool myself, however much I may look it; and I am as beautiful as the day, or at least I once hoped that perhaps I might be going to be.  And so I might.  So that you see we are well met, and peers on these important points.  I am <hi rend="italic">very</hi> glad also that you are older than your sister.  So should I have been, if I had had one.  So that the number of points and virtues which you have inherited from your name-father is already quite surprising.</p>
                     <p>I wish you would tell your father—not that I like to encourage my rival—that we have had a wonderful time here of late, and that they are having a cold day on Mulinuu, and the consuls are writing reports, and I am writing to the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, and if we don’t get rid of our friends this time I shall begin to despair of everything but my name-daughter.</p>
                     <p>You are quite wrong as to the effect of the birthday on your age.  From the moment the deed was registered (as it was in the public press with every solemnity), the 13th of November became your own <hi rend="italic">and only</hi> birthday, and you ceased to have been born on Christmas Day.  Ask your father: I am sure he will tell you this is sound law.  You are thus become a month and twelve days younger than you were, but will go on growing older for the future in the regular and human manner from one 13th November to the next.  The effect on me is more doubtful; I may, as you suggest, live for ever; I might, on the other hand, come to pieces like the one-horse shay at a moment’s notice; doubtless the step was risky, but I do not the least regret that which enables me to sign myself your revered and delighted name-father,</p>

                     <p>DEAR SIR,—Your obliging communication is to hand.  I am glad to find that you have read some of my books, and to see that you spell my name right.  This is a point (for some reason) of great difficulty; and I believe that a gentleman who can spell Stevenson with a v at sixteen, should have a show for the Presidency before fifty.  By that time</p>
                     <p>I, nearer to the wayside inn,</p>
                     <p>predict that you will have outgrown your taste for autographs, but perhaps your son may have inherited the collection, and on the morning of the great day will recall my prophecy to your mind.  And in the papers of 1921 (say) this letter may arouse a smile.</p>
                     <p>Whatever you do, read something else besides novels and newspapers; the first are good enough when they are good; the second, at their best, are worth nothing.  Read great books of literature and history; try to understand the Roman Empire and the Middle Ages; be sure you do not understand when you dislike them; condemnation is non-comprehension.  And if you know something of these two periods, you will know a little more about to-day, and may be a good President.</p>
                     <p>I send you my best wishes, and am yours,</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR BURLINGAME,—The end of <hi rend="italic">The Wrecker</hi> having but just come in, you will, I dare say, be appalled to receive three (possibly four) chapters of a new book of the least attractive sort: a history of nowhere in a corner, for no time to mention, running to a volume!  Well, it may very likely be an illusion; it is very likely no one could possibly wish to read it, but I wish to publish it.  If you don’t cotton to the idea, kindly set it up at my expense, and let me know your terms for publishing.  The great affair to me is to have per return (if it might be) four or five—better say half a dozen—sets of the roughest proofs that can be drawn.  There are a good many men here whom I want to read the blessed thing, and not one would have the energy to read MS.  At the same time, if you care to glance at it, and have the time, I should be very glad of your opinion as to whether I have made any step at all towards possibly inducing folk at home to read matter so extraneous and outlandish.  I become heavy and owlish; years sit upon me; it begins to seem to me to be a man’s business to leave off his damnable faces and say his say.  Else I could have made it pungent and light and lively.  In considering, kindly forget that I am R. L. S.; think of the four chapters as a book you are reading, by an inhabitant of our ‘lovely but fatil’ islands; and see if it could possibly amuse the hebetated public.  I have to publish anyway, you understand; I have a purpose beyond; I am concerned for some of the parties to this quarrel.  What I want to hear is from curiosity; what I want you to judge of is what we are to do with the book in a business sense.  To me it is not business at all; I had meant originally to lay all the profits to the credit of Samoa; when it comes to the pinch of writing, I judge this unfair—I give too much—and I mean to keep (if there be any profit at all) one-half for the artisan; the rest I shall hold over to give to the Samoans <hi rend="italic">for that which I choose and against work done</hi>.  I think I have never heard of greater insolence than to attempt such a subject; yet the tale is so strange and mixed, and the people so oddly charactered—above all, the whites—and the high note of the hurricane and the warships is so well prepared to take popular interest, and the latter part is so directly in the day’s movement, that I am not without hope but some may read it; and if they don’t, a murrain on them!  Here is, for the first time, a tale of Greeks—Homeric Greeks—mingled with moderns, and all true; Odysseus alongside of Rajah Brooke, <hi rend="italic">proportion gardée</hi>; and all true.  Here is for the first time since the Greeks (that I remember) the history of a handful of men, where all know each other in the eyes, and live close in a few acres, narrated at length, and with the seriousness of history.  Talk of the modern novel; here is a modern history.  And if I had the misfortune to found a school, the legitimate historian might lie down and die, for he could never overtake his material.  Here is a little tale that has not ‘caret’-ed its ‘vates’; ‘sacer’ is another point.</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR HENRY JAMES,—Thanks for yours; your former letter was lost; so it appears was my long and masterly treatise on the <hi rend="italic">Tragic Muse</hi>.  I remember sending it very well, and there went by the same mail a long and masterly tractate to Gosse about his daddy’s life, for which I have been long expecting an acknowledgment, and which is plainly gone to the bottom with the other.  If you see Gosse, please mention it.  These gems of criticism are now lost literature, like the tomes of Alexandria.  I could not do ’em again.  And I must ask you to be content with a dull head, a weary hand, and short commons, for to-day, as I am physically tired with hard work of every kind, the labours of the planter and the author both piled upon me mountain deep.  I am delighted beyond expression by Bourget’s book: he has phrases which affect me almost like Montaigne; I had read ere this a masterly essay of his on Pascal; this book does it; I write for all his essays by this mail, and shall try to meet him when I come to Europe.  The proposal is to pass a summer in France, I think in Royat, where the faithful could come and visit me; they are now not many.  I expect Henry James to come and break a crust or two with us.  I believe it will be only my wife and myself; and she will go over to England, but not I, or possibly incog. to Southampton, and then to Boscombe to see poor Lady Shelley.  I am writing—trying to write in a Babel fit for the bottomless pit; my wife, her daughter, her grandson and my mother, all shrieking at each other round the house—not in war, thank God! but the din is ultra martial, and the note of Lloyd joins in occasionally, and the cause of this to-do is simply cacao, whereof chocolate comes.  You may drink of our chocolate perhaps in five or six years from now, and not know it.  It makes a fine bustle, and gives us some hard work, out of which I have slunk for to-day.</p>
                     <p>I have a story coming out: God knows when or how; it answers to the name of the <hi rend="italic">Beach of Falesà</hi>, and I think well of it.  I was delighted with the <hi rend="italic">Tragic Muse</hi>; I thought the Muse herself one of your best works; I was delighted also to hear of the success of your piece, as you know I am a dam failure, <ref target="#6855990405419608431_637-h-3.htm.xhtml#footnote245">[245]</ref> and might have dined with the dinner club that Daudet and these parties frequented.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Next day</hi>.</p>
                     <p>I have just been breakfasting at Baiae and Brindisi, and the charm of Bourget hag-rides me.  I wonder if this exquisite fellow, all made of fiddle-strings and scent and intelligence, could bear any of my bald prose.  If you think he could, ask Colvin to send him a copy of these last essays of mine when they appear; and tell Bourget they go to him from a South Sea Island as literal homage.  I have read no new book for years that gave me the same literary thrill as his <hi rend="italic">Sensations d’Italie</hi>.  If (as I imagine) my cut-and-dry literature would be death to him, and worse than death—journalism—be silent on the point.  For I have a great curiosity to know him, and if he doesn’t know my work, I shall have the better chance of making his acquaintance.  I read <hi rend="italic">The Pupil</hi> the other day with great joy; your little boy is admirable; why is there no little boy like that unless he hails from the Great Republic?</p>
                     <p>Here I broke off, and wrote Bourget a dedication; no use resisting; it’s a love affair.  O, he’s exquisite, I bless you for the gift of him.  I have really enjoyed this book as I—almost as I—used to enjoy books when I was going twenty—twenty-three; and these are the years for reading!</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR BURLINGAME,—Overjoyed you were pleased with <hi rend="italic">Wrecker</hi>, and shall consider your protests.  There is perhaps more art than you think for in the peccant chapter, where I have succeeded in packing into one a dedication, an explanation, and a termination.  Surely you had not recognised the phrase about boodle?  It was a quotation from Jim Pinkerton, and seemed to me agreeably skittish.  However, all shall be prayerfully considered.</p>
                     <p>To come to a more painful subject.  Herewith go three more chapters of the wretched <hi rend="italic">History</hi>; as you see, I approach the climax.  I expect the book to be some 70,000 words, of which you have now 45.  Can I finish it for next mail?  I am going to try!  ’Tis a long piece of journalism, and full of difficulties here and there, of this kind and that, and will make me a power of friends to be sure.  There is one Becker who will probably put up a window to me in the church where he was baptized; and I expect a testimonial from Captain Hand.</p>
                     <p>Sorry to let the mail go without the Scott; this has been a bad month with me, and I have been below myself.  I shall find a way to have it come by next, or know the reason why.  The mail after, anyway.</p>
                     <p>A bit of a sketch map appears to me necessary for my <hi rend="italic">History</hi>; perhaps two.  If I do not have any, ’tis impossible any one should follow; and I, even when not at all interested, demand that I shall be able to follow; even a tourist book without a map is a cross to me; and there must be others of my way of thinking.  I inclose the very artless one that I think needful.  Vailima, in case you are curious, is about as far again behind Tanugamanono as that is from the sea.</p>
                     <p>M‘Clure is publishing a short story of mine, some 50,000 words, I think, <hi rend="italic">The Beach of Falesà</hi>; when he’s done with it, I want you and Cassell to bring it out in a little volume; I shall send you a dedication for it; I believe it good; indeed, to be honest, very good.  Good gear that pleases the merchant.</p>
                     <p>The other map that I half threaten is a chart for the hurricane.  Get me Kimberley’s report of the hurricane: not to be found here.  It is of most importance; I <hi rend="italic">must</hi> have it with my proofs of that part, if I cannot have it earlier, which now seems impossible.—Yours in hot haste,</p>

                     <p>DEAR MR. BARRIE,—This is at least the third letter I have written you, but my correspondence has a bad habit of not getting so far as the post.  That which I possess of manhood turns pale before the business of the address and envelope.  But I hope to be more fortunate with this: for, besides the usual and often recurrent desire to thank you for your work-you are one of four that have come to the front since I was watching and had a corner of my own to watch, and there is no reason, unless it be in these mysterious tides that ebb and flow, and make and mar and murder the works of poor scribblers, why you should not do work of the best order.  The tides have borne away my sentence, of which I was weary at any rate, and between authors I may allow myself so much freedom as to leave it pending.  We are both Scots besides, and I suspect both rather Scotty Scots; my own Scotchness tends to intermittency, but is at times erisypelitous—if that be rightly spelt.  Lastly, I have gathered we had both made our stages in the metropolis of the winds: our Virgil’s ‘grey metropolis,’ and I count that a lasting bond.  No place so brands a man.</p>
                     <p>Finally, I feel it a sort of duty to you to report progress.  This may be an error, but I believed I detected your hand in an article—it may be an illusion, it may have been by one of those industrious insects who catch up and reproduce the handling of each emergent man—but I’ll still hope it was yours—and hope it may please you to hear that the continuation of <hi rend="italic">Kidnapped</hi> is under way.  I have not yet got to Alan, so I do not know if he is still alive, but David seems to have a kick or two in his shanks.  I was pleased to see how the Anglo-Saxon theory fell into the trap: I gave my Lowlander a Gaelic name, and even commented on the fact in the text; yet almost all critics recognised in Alan and David a Saxon and a Celt.  I know not about England; in Scotland at least, where Gaelic was spoken in Fife little over the century ago, and in Galloway not much earlier, I deny that there exists such a thing as a pure Saxon, and I think it more than questionable if there be such a thing as a pure Celt.</p>
                     <p>But what have you to do with this? and what have I?  Let us continue to inscribe our little bits of tales, and let the heathen rage!  Yours, with sincere interest in your career,</p>
                     <p>Robert Louis Stevenson.</p>

                     <p>MASTER,—A plea from a place so distant should have some weight, and from a heart so grateful should have some address.  I have been long in your debt, Master, and I did not think it could be so much increased as you have now increased it.  I was long in your debt and deep in your debt for many poems that I shall never forget, and for <hi rend="italic">Sigurd</hi> before all, and now you have plunged me beyond payment by the Saga Library.  And so now, true to human nature, being plunged beyond payment, I come and bark at your heels.</p>
                     <p>For surely, Master, that tongue that we write, and that you have illustrated so nobly, is yet alive.  She has her rights and laws, and is our mother, our queen, and our instrument.  Now in that living tongue <hi rend="italic">where</hi> has one sense, <hi rend="italic">whereas</hi> another.  In the <hi rend="italic">Heathslayings Story</hi>, p. 241, line 13, it bears one of its ordinary senses.  Elsewhere and usually through the two volumes, which is all that has yet reached me of this entrancing publication, <hi rend="italic">whereas</hi> is made to figure for <hi rend="italic">where</hi>.</p>
                     <p>For the love of God, my dear and honoured Morris, use <hi rend="italic">where</hi>, and let us know <hi rend="italic">whereas</hi> we are, wherefore our gratitude shall grow, whereby you shall be the more honoured wherever men love clear language, whereas now, although we honour, we are troubled.</p>

                     <p>[<hi rend="italic">Vailima</hi>, <hi rend="italic">March</hi> 1892.]</p>
                     <p>MY DEAR MRS. FAIRCHILD,—I am guilty in your sight, but my affairs besiege me.     The chief-justiceship of a family of nineteen persons is in itself no sinecure, and sometimes occupies me for days: two weeks ago for four days almost entirely, and for two days entirely.  Besides which, I have in the last few months written all but one chapter of a <hi rend="italic">History of Samoa</hi> for the last eight or nine years; and while I was unavoidably delayed in the writing of this, awaiting material, put in one-half of <hi rend="italic">David Balfour</hi>, the sequel to <hi rend="italic">Kidnapped</hi>.  Add the ordinary impediments of life, and admire my busyness.  I am now an old, but healthy skeleton, and degenerate much towards the machine.  By six at work: stopped at half-past ten to give a history lesson to a step-grandson; eleven, lunch; after lunch we have a musical performance till two; then to work again; bath, 4.40, dinner, five; cards in the evening till eight; and then to bed—only I have no bed, only a chest with a mat and blankets—and read myself to sleep.  This is the routine, but often sadly interrupted.  Then you may see me sitting on the floor of my verandah haranguing and being harangued by squatting chiefs on a question of a road; or more privately holding an inquiry into some dispute among our familiars, myself on my bed, the boys on the floor—for when it comes to the judicial I play dignity—or else going down to Apia on some more or less unsatisfactory errand.  Altogether it is a life that suits me, but it absorbs me like an ocean.  That is what I have always envied and admired in Scott; with all that immensity of work and study, his mind kept flexible, glancing to all points of natural interest.  But the lean hot spirits, such as mine, become hypnotised with their bit occupations—if I may use Scotch to you—it is so far more scornful than any English idiom.  Well, I can’t help being a skeleton, and you are to take this devious passage for an apology.</p>
                     <p>I thought <hi rend="italic">Aladdin</hi> capital fun; but why, in fortune, did he pretend it was moral at the end?  The so-called nineteenth century, <hi rend="italic">où va-t-il se nicher</hi>?  ’Tis a trifle, but Pyle would do well to knock the passage out, and leave his boguey tale a boguey tale, and a good one at that.</p>
                     <p>The arrival of your box was altogether a great success to the castaways.  You have no idea where we live.  Do you know, in all these islands there are not five hundred whites, and no postal delivery, and only one village—it is no more—and would be a mean enough village in Europe?  We were asked the other day if Vailima were the name of our post town, and we laughed.  Do you know, though we are but three miles from the village metropolis, we have no road to it, and our goods are brought on the pack-saddle?  And do you know—or I should rather say, can you believe—or (in the famous old Tichborne trial phrase) would you be surprised to learn, that all you have read of Vailima—or Subpriorsford, as I call it—is entirely false, and we have no ice-machine, and no electric light, and no water supply but the cistern of the heavens, and but one public room, and scarce a bedroom apiece?  But, of course, it is well known that I have made enormous sums by my evanescent literature, and you will smile at my false humility.  The point, however, is much on our minds just now.  We are expecting an invasion of Kiplings; very glad we shall be to see them; but two of the party are ladies, and I tell you we had to hold a council of war to stow them.  You European ladies are so particular; with all of mine, sleeping has long become a public function, as with natives and those who go down much into the sea in ships.</p>
                     <p>Dear Mrs. Fairchild, I must go to my work.  I have but two words to say in conclusion.</p>
                     <p>First, civilisation is rot.</p>
                     <p>Second, console a savage with more of the milk of that over civilised being, your adorable schoolboy.</p>
                     <p>As I wrote these remarkable words, I was called down to eight o’clock prayers, and have just worked through a chapter of Joshua and five verses, with five treble choruses of a Samoan hymn; but the music was good, our boys and precentress (’tis always a woman that leads) did better than I ever heard them, and to my great pleasure I understood it all except one verse.  This gave me the more time to try and identify what the parts were doing, and further convict my dull ear.  Beyond the fact that the soprano rose to the tonic above, on one occasion I could recognise nothing.  This is sickening, but I mean to teach my ear better before I am done with it or this vile carcase.</p>
                     <p>I think it will amuse you (for a last word) to hear that our precentress—she is the washerwoman—is our shame.  She is a good, healthy, comely, strapping young wench, full of energy and seriousness, a splendid workwoman, delighting to train our chorus, delighting in the poetry of the hymns, which she reads aloud (on the least provocation) with a great sentiment of rhythm.  Well, then, what is curious?  Ah, we did not know! but it was told us in a whisper from the cook-house—she is not of good family.  Don’t let it get out, please; everybody knows it, of course, here; there is no reason why Europe and the States should have the advantage of me also.  And the rest of my housefolk are all chief-people, I assure you.  And my late overseer (far the best of his race) is a really serious chief with a good ‘name.’  Tina is the name; it is not in the Almanach de Gotha, it must have got dropped at press.  The odd thing is, we rather share the prejudice.  I have almost always—though not quite always—found the higher the chief the better the man through all the islands; or, at least, that the best man came always from a highish rank.  I hope Helen will continue to prove a bright exception.</p>
                     <p>With love to Fairchild and the Huge Schoolboy, I am, my dear Mrs. Fairchild, yours very sincerely,</p>
                     <p>Robert Louis Stevenson.</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR BURLINGAME,—Herewith Chapters IX. and X., and I am left face to face with the horrors and dilemmas of the present regimen: pray for those that go down to the sea in ships.  I have promised Henley shall have a chance to publish the hurricane chapter if he like, so please let the slips be sent <hi rend="italic">quam primum</hi> to C. Baxter, W.S., 11 S. Charlotte Street, Edinburgh.  I got on mighty quick with that chapter—about five days of the toughest kind of work.  God forbid I should ever have such another pirn to wind!  When I invent a language, there shall be a direct and an indirect pronoun differently declined—then writing would be some fun.</p>

                     <p>Sir,—In reply to your very interesting letter, I cannot fairly say that I have ever been poor, or known what it was to want a meal.  I have been reduced, however, to a very small sum of money, with no apparent prospect of increasing it; and at that time I reduced myself to practically one meal a day, with the most disgusting consequences to my health.  At this time I lodged in the house of a working man, and associated much with others.  At the same time, from my youth up, I have always been a good deal and rather intimately thrown among the working-classes, partly as a civil engineer in out-of-the-way places, partly from a strong and, I hope, not ill-favoured sentiment of curiosity.  But the place where, perhaps, I was most struck with the fact upon which you comment was the house of a friend, who was exceedingly poor, in fact, I may say destitute, and who lived in the attic of a very tall house entirely inhabited by persons in varying stages of poverty.  As he was also in ill-health, I made a habit of passing my afternoon with him, and when there it was my part to answer the door.  The steady procession of people begging, and the expectant and confident manner in which they presented themselves, struck me more and more daily; and I could not but remember with surprise that though my father lived but a few streets away in a fine house, beggars scarce came to the door once a fortnight or a month.  From that time forward I made it my business to inquire, and in the stories which I am very fond of hearing from all sorts and conditions of men, learned that in the time of their distress it was always from the poor they sought assistance, and almost always from the poor they got it.</p>
                     <p>Trusting I have now satisfactorily answered your question, which I thank you for asking, I remain, with sincere compliments,</p>
                     <p>Robert Louis Stevenson.</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR BURLINGAME,—First of all, <hi rend="italic">you have all the corrections on</hi> ‘<hi rend="italic">The Wrecker</hi>.’  I found I had made what I meant and forgotten it, and was so careless as not to tell you.</p>
                     <p>Second, of course, and by all means, charge corrections on the Samoa book to me; but there are not near so many as I feared.  The Lord hath dealt bountifully with me, and I believe all my advisers were amazed to see how nearly correct I had got the truck, at least I was.  With this you will receive the whole revise and a typewritten copy of the last chapter.  And the thing now is Speed, to catch a possible revision of the treaty.  I believe Cassells are to bring it out, but Baxter knows, and the thing has to be crammed through <hi rend="italic">prestissimo</hi>, <hi rend="italic">à la chasseur</hi>.</p>
                     <p>You mention the belated Barbeys; what about the equally belated Pineros?  And I hope you will keep your bookshop alive to supplying me continuously with the <hi rend="italic">Saga Library</hi>.  I cannot get enough of <hi rend="italic">Sagas</hi>; I wish there were nine thousand; talk about realism!</p>
                     <p>All seems to flourish with you; I also prosper; none the less for being quit of that abhorred task, Samoa.  I could give a supper party here were there any one to sup.  Never was such a disagreeable task, but the thing had to be told. . . .</p>
                     <p>There, I trust I am done with this cursed chapter of my career, bar the rotten eggs and broken bottles that may follow, of course.  Pray remember, speed is now all that can be asked, hoped, or wished.  I give up all hope of proofs, revises, proof of the map, or sic like; and you on your side will try to get it out as reasonably seemly as may be.</p>
                     <p>Whole Samoa book herewith.  Glory be to God.—Yours very sincerely,</p>
                     <p>Robert Louis Stevenson.</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR CHARLES,—. . . I have been now for some time contending with powers and principalities, and I have never once seen one of my own letters to the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>.  So when you see something in the papers that you think might interest the exiles of Upolu, do not think twice, out with your saxpence, and send it flying to Vailima.  Of what you say of the past, eh, man, it was a queer time, and awful miserable, but there’s no sense in denying it was awful fun.  Do you mind the youth in Highland garb and the tableful of coppers?  Do you mind the SIGNAL of Waterloo Place?—Hey, how the blood stands to the heart at such a memory!—Hae ye the notes o’t?  Gie’s them.—Gude’s sake, man, gie’s the notes o’t; I mind ye made a tune o’t an’ played it on your pinanny; gie’s the notes.  Dear Lord, that past.</p>
                     <p>Glad to hear Henley’s prospects are fair: his new volume is the work of a real poet.  He is one of those who can make a noise of his own with words, and in whom experience strikes an individual note.  There is perhaps no more genuine poet living, bar the Big Guns.  In case I cannot overtake an acknowledgment to himself by this mail, please let him hear of my pleasure and admiration.  How poorly—compares!  He is all smart journalism and cleverness: it is all bright and shallow and limpid, like a business paper—a good one, <hi rend="italic">s’entend</hi>; but there is no blot of heart’s blood and the Old Night: there are no harmonics, there is scarce harmony to his music; and in Henley—all of these; a touch, a sense within sense, a sound outside the sound, the shadow of the inscrutable, eloquent beyond all definition.  The First London Voluntary knocked me wholly.—Ever yours affectionately, my dear Charles,</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR HENLEY,—It is impossible to let your new volume pass in silence.  I have not received the same thrill of poetry since G. M.’s <hi rend="italic">Joy of Earth</hi> volume and <hi rend="italic">Love in a Valley</hi>; and I do not know that even that was so intimate and deep.  Again and again, I take the book down, and read, and my blood is fired as it used to be in youth.  <hi rend="italic">Andante con moto</hi> in the <hi rend="italic">Voluntaries</hi>, and the thing about the trees at night (No. XXIV. I think) are up to date my favourites.  I did not guess you were so great a magician; these are new tunes, this is an undertone of the true Apollo; these are not verse, they are poetry—inventions, creations, in language.  I thank you for the joy you have given me, and remain your old friend and present huge admirer,</p>

                     <p>For the next edition of the Book of Verses, pray accept an emendation.  Last three lines of Echoes No. XLIV. read—</p>

                     <p>The two vocatives scatter the effect of this inimitable close.  If you insist on the longer line, equip ‘grave’ with an epithet.</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR BURLINGAME,—Herewith <hi rend="italic">My Grandfather</hi>.  I have had rather a bad time suppressing the old gentleman, who was really in a very garrulous stage; as for getting him <hi rend="italic">in order</hi>, I could do but little towards that; however, there are one or two points of interest which may justify us in printing.  The swinging of his stick and not knowing the sailor of Coruiskin, in particular, and the account of how he wrote the lives in the Bell Book particularly please me. I hope my own little introduction is not egoistic; or rather I do not care if it is.  It was that old gentleman’s blood that brought me to Samoa.</p>
                     <p>By the by, vols. vii., viii., and ix. of Adams’s <hi rend="italic">History</hi> have never come to hand; no more have the dictionaries.</p>
                     <p>Please send me <hi rend="italic">Stonehenge on Horse</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Stories and Interludes</hi> by Barry Pain, and <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Sketches and Memoirs</hi> by David Masson.  <hi rend="italic">The Wrecker</hi> has turned up.  So far as I have seen, it is very satisfactory, but on pp. 548, 549, there has been a devil of a miscarriage.  The two Latin quotations instead of following each other being separated (doubtless for printing considerations) by a line of prose.  My compliments to the printers; there is doubtless such a thing as good printing, but there is such a thing as good sense.</p>
                     <p>The sequel to <hi rend="italic">Kidnapped</hi>, <hi rend="italic">David Balfour</hi> by name, is about three-quarters done and gone to press for serial publication.  By what I can find out it ought to be through hand with that and ready for volume form early next spring.—Yours very sincerely,</p>

                     <p>[<hi rend="italic">Vailima</hi>, <hi rend="italic">August</hi> 1892.]</p>
                     <p>MY DEAR LANG,—I knew you would prove a trusty purveyor.  The books you have sent are admirable.  I got the name of my hero out of Brown—Blair of Balmyle—Francie Blair.  But whether to call the story <hi rend="italic">Blair of Balmyle</hi>, or whether to call it <hi rend="italic">The Young Chevalier</hi>, I have not yet decided.  The admirable Cameronian tract—perhaps you will think this a cheat—is to be boned into <hi rend="italic">David Balfour</hi>, where it will fit better, and really furnishes me with a desired foothold over a boggy place.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Later</hi>; no, it won’t go in, and I fear I must give up ‘the idolatrous occupant upon the throne,’ a phrase that overjoyed me beyond expression.  I am in a deuce of a flutter with politics, which I hate, and in which I certainly do not shine; but a fellow cannot stand aside and look on at such an exhibition as our government.  ’Taint decent; no gent can hold a candle to it.  But it’s a grind to be interrupted by midnight messengers and pass your days writing proclamations (which are never proclaimed) and petitions (which ain’t petited) and letters to the <hi rend="italic">Times</hi>, which it makes my jaws yawn to re-read, and all your time have your heart with David Balfour: he has just left Glasgow this morning for Edinburgh, James More has escaped from the castle; it is far more real to me than the Behring Sea or the Baring brothers either—he got the news of James More’s escape from the Lord Advocate, and started off straight to comfort Catriona.  You don’t know her; she’s James More’s daughter, and a respectable young wumman; the Miss Grants think so—the Lord Advocate’s daughters—so there can’t be anything really wrong.  Pretty soon we all go to Holland, and be hanged; thence to Dunkirk, and be damned; and the tale concludes in Paris, and be Poll-parrotted.  This is the last authentic news.  You are not a real hard-working novelist; not a practical novelist; so you don’t know the temptation to let your characters maunder.  Dumas did it, and lived.  But it is not war; it ain’t sportsmanlike, and I have to be stopping their chatter all the time.  Brown’s appendix is great reading.</p>
                     <p>My only grief is that I can’t<lb/>Use the idolatrous occupant.</p>

                     <p>TO MISS AMELIA BALFOUR—MY DEAR COUSIN,—We are going an expedition to leeward on Tuesday morning.  If a lady were perhaps to be encountered on horseback—say, towards the Gasi-gasi river—about six A.M., I think we should have an episode somewhat after the style of the ’45.  What a misfortune, my dear cousin, that you should have arrived while your cousin Graham was occupying my only guest-chamber—for Osterley Park is not so large in Samoa as it was at home—but happily our friend Haggard has found a corner for you!</p>
                     <p>The King over the Water—the Gasi-gasi water—will be pleased to see the clan of Balfour mustering so thick around his standard.</p>

                     <p>The Master of Haggard might extend his ride a little, and return through the marsh and by the nuns’ house (I trust that has the proper flavour), so as a little to diminish the effect of separation.—I remain, your affectionate cousin to command,</p>

                     <p>[<hi rend="italic">Vailima</hi>, <hi rend="italic">August</hi> 1892.]</p>
                     <p>MY DEAR MRS. FAIRCHILD,—Thank you a thousand times for your letter.  You are the Angel of (the sort of) Information (that I care about); I appoint you successor to the newspaper press; and I beg of you, whenever you wish to gird at the age, or think the bugs out of proportion to the roses, or despair, or enjoy any cosmic or epochal emotion, to sit down again and write to the Hermit of Samoa.  What do I think of it all?  Well, I love the romantic solemnity of youth; and even in this form, although not without laughter, I have to love it still.  They are such ducks!  But what are they made of?  We were just as solemn as that about atheism and the stars and humanity; but we were all for belief anyway—we held atheism and sociology (of which none of us, nor indeed anybody, knew anything) for a gospel and an iron rule of life; and it was lucky enough, or there would have been more windows broken.  What is apt to puzzle one at first sight in the New Youth is that, with such rickety and risky problems always at heart, they should not plunge down a Niagara of Dissolution.  But let us remember the high practical timidity of youth.  I was a particularly brave boy—this I think of myself, looking back—and plunged into adventures and experiments, and ran risks that it still surprises me to recall.  But, dear me, what a fear I was in of that strange blind machinery in the midst of which I stood; and with what a compressed heart and what empty lungs I would touch a new crank and await developments!  I do not mean to say I do not fear life still; I do; and that terror (for an adventurer like myself) is still one of the chief joys of living.</p>
                     <p>But it was different indeed while I was yet girt with the priceless robes of inexperience; then the fear was exquisite and infinite.  And so, when you see all these little Ibsens, who seem at once so dry and so excitable, and faint in swathes over a play (I suppose—for a wager) that would seem to me merely tedious, smile behind your hand, and remember the little dears are all in a blue funk.  It must be very funny, and to a spectator like yourself I almost envy it.  But never get desperate; human nature is human nature; and the Roman Empire, since the Romans founded it and made our European human nature what it is, bids fair to go on and to be true to itself.  These little bodies will all grow up and become men and women, and have heaps of fun; nay, and are having it now; and whatever happens to the fashion of the age, it makes no difference—there are always high and brave and amusing lives to be lived; and a change of key, however exotic, does not exclude melody.  Even Chinamen, hard as we find it to believe, enjoy being Chinese.  And the Chinaman stands alone to be unthinkable; natural enough, as the representative of the only other great civilisation.  Take my people here at my doors; their life is a very good one; it is quite thinkable, quite acceptable to us.  And the little dears will be soon skating on the other foot; sooner or later, in each generation, the one-half of them at least begin to remember all the material they had rejected when first they made and nailed up their little theory of life; and these become reactionaries or conservatives, and the ship of man begins to fill upon the other tack.</p>
                     <p>Here is a sermon, by your leave!  It is your own fault, you have amused and interested me so much by your breath of the New Youth, which comes to me from so far away, where I live up here in my mountain, and secret messengers bring me letters from rebels, and the government sometimes seizes them, and generally grumbles in its beard that Stevenson should really be deported.  O, my life is the more lively, never fear!</p>
                     <p>It has recently been most amusingly varied by a visit from Lady Jersey.  I took her over mysteriously (under the pseudonym of my cousin, Miss Amelia Balfour) to visit Mataafa, our rebel; and we had great fun, and wrote a Ouida novel on our life here, in which every author had to describe himself in the Ouida glamour, and of which—for the Jerseys intend printing it—I must let you have a copy.  My wife’s chapter, and my description of myself, should, I think, amuse you.  But there were finer touches still; as when Belle and Lady Jersey came out to brush their teeth in front of the rebel King’s palace, and the night guard squatted opposite on the grass and watched the process; or when I and my interpreter, and the King with his secretary, mysteriously disappeared to conspire.—Ever yours sincerely,</p>

                     <p>DEAR SIR,—I only know you under the initials G. B., but you have done some exceedingly spirited and satisfactory illustrations to my story <hi rend="italic">The Beach of Falesà</hi>, and I wish to write and thank you expressly for the care and talent shown.  Such numbers of people can do good black and whites!  So few can illustrate a story, or apparently read it.  You have shown that you can do both, and your creation of Wiltshire is a real illumination of the text.  It was exactly so that Wiltshire dressed and looked, and you have the line of his nose to a nicety.  His nose is an inspiration.  Nor should I forget to thank you for Case, particularly in his last appearance.  It is a singular fact—which seems to point still more directly to inspiration in your case—that your missionary actually resembles the flesh-and-blood person from whom Mr. Tarleton was drawn.  The general effect of the islands is all that could be wished; indeed I have but one criticism to make, that in the background of Case taking the dollar from Mr. Tarleton’s head—head—not hand, as the fools have printed it—the natives have a little too much the look of Africans.</p>
                     <p>But the great affair is that you have been to the pains to illustrate my story instead of making conscientious black and whites of people sitting talking.  I doubt if you have left unrepresented a single pictorial incident.  I am writing by this mail to the editor in the hopes that I may buy from him the originals, and I am, dear sir, your very much obliged,</p>

                     <p>DEAR MADAM,—I have a great diffidence in answering your valued letter.  It would be difficult for me to express the feelings with which I read it—and am now trying to re-read it as I dictate this.</p>
                     <p>You ask me to forgive what you say ‘must seem a liberty,’ and I find that I cannot thank you sufficiently or even find a word with which to qualify your letter.  Dear Madam, such a communication even the vainest man would think a sufficient reward for a lifetime of labour.  That I should have been able to give so much help and pleasure to your sister is the subject of my grateful wonder.</p>
                     <p>That she, being dead, and speaking with your pen, should be able to repay the debt with such a liberal interest, is one of those things that reconcile us with the world and make us take hope again.  I do not know what I have done to deserve so beautiful and touching a compliment; and I feel there is but one thing fit for me to say here, that I will try with renewed courage to go on in the same path, and to deserve, if not to receive, a similar return from others.</p>
                     <p>You apologise for speaking so much about yourselves.  Dear Madam, I thought you did so too little.  I should have wished to have known more of those who were so sympathetic as to find a consolation in my work, and so graceful and so tactful as to acknowledge it in such a letter as was yours.</p>
                     <p>Will you offer to your mother the expression of a sympathy which (coming from a stranger) must seem very airy, but which yet is genuine; and accept for yourself my gratitude for the thought which inspired you to write to me and the words which you found to express it.</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR BURLINGAME,—It is now, as you see, the 10th of October, and there has not reached the Island of Upolu one single copy, or rag of a copy, of the Samoa book.  I lie; there has come one, and that in the pocket of a missionary man who is at daggers drawn with me, who lends it to all my enemies, conceals it from all my friends, and is bringing a lawsuit against me on the strength of expressions in the same which I have forgotten, and now cannot see.  This is pretty tragic, I think you will allow; and I was inclined to fancy it was the fault of the Post Office.  But I hear from my sister-in-law Mrs. Sanchez that she is in the same case, and has received no ‘Footnote.’  I have also to consider that I had no letter from you last mail, although you ought to have received by that time ‘My Grandfather and Scott,’ and ‘Me and my Grandfather.’  Taking one consideration with another, therefore, I prefer to conceive that No. 743 Broadway has fallen upon gentle and continuous slumber, and is become an enchanted palace among publishing houses.  If it be not so, if the ‘Footnotes’ were really sent, I hope you will fall upon the Post Office with all the vigour you possess.  How does <hi rend="italic">The Wrecker</hi> go in the States?  It seems to be doing exceptionally well in England.—Yours sincerely,</p>

                     <p>DEAR MR. BARRIE,—I can scarce thank you sufficiently for your extremely amusing letter.  No, <hi rend="italic">The Auld Licht Idyls</hi> never reached me—I wish it had, and I wonder extremely whether it would not be good for me to have a pennyworth of the Auld Licht pulpit.  It is a singular thing that I should live here in the South Seas under conditions so new and so striking, and yet my imagination so continually inhabit that cold old huddle of grey hills from which we come.  I have just finished <hi rend="italic">David Balfour</hi>; I have another book on the stocks, <hi rend="italic">The Young Chevalier</hi>, which is to be part in France and part in Scotland, and to deal with Prince Charlie about the year 1749; and now what have I done but begun a third which is to be all moorland together, and is to have for a centrepiece a figure that I think you will appreciate—that of the immortal Braxfield—Braxfield himself is my <hi rend="italic">grand premier</hi>, or, since you are so much involved in the British drama, let me say my heavy lead. . . .</p>
                     <p>Your descriptions of your dealings with Lord Rintoul are frightfully unconscientious.  You should never write about anybody until you persuade yourself at least for the moment that you love him, above all anybody on whom your plot revolves.  It will always make a hole in the book; and, if he has anything to do with the mechanism, prove a stick in your machinery.  But you know all this better than I do, and it is one of your most promising traits that you do not take your powers too seriously.  The <hi rend="italic">Little Minister</hi> ought to have ended badly; we all know it did; and we are infinitely grateful to you for the grace and good feeling with which you lied about it.  If you had told the truth, I for one could never have forgiven you.  As you had conceived and written the earlier parts, the truth about the end, though indisputably true to fact, would have been a lie, or what is worse, a discord in art.  If you are going to make a book end badly, it must end badly from the beginning.  Now your book began to end well.  You let yourself fall in love with, and fondle, and smile at your puppets.  Once you had done that, your honour was committed—at the cost of truth to life you were bound to save them.  It is the blot on <hi rend="italic">Richard Feverel</hi>, for instance, that it begins to end well; and then tricks you and ends ill.  But in that case there is worse behind, for the ill-ending does not inherently issue from the plot—the story <hi rend="italic">had</hi>, in fact, <hi rend="italic">ended well</hi> after the great last interview between Richard and Lucy—and the blind, illogical bullet which smashes all has no more to do between the boards than a fly has to do with the room into whose open window it comes buzzing.  It <hi rend="italic">might</hi> have so happened; it needed not; and unless needs must, we have no right to pain our readers.  I have had a heavy case of conscience of the same kind about my Braxfield story.  Braxfield—only his name is Hermiston—has a son who is condemned to death; plainly, there is a fine tempting fitness about this; and I meant he was to hang.  But now on considering my minor characters, I saw there were five people who would—in a sense who must—break prison and attempt his rescue.  They were capable, hardy folks, too, who might very well succeed.  Why should they not then?  Why should not young Hermiston escape clear out of the country? and be happy, if he could, with his—  But soft!  I will not betray my secret of my heroine.  Suffice it to breathe in your ear that she was what Hardy calls (and others in their plain way don’t) a Pure Woman.  Much virtue in a capital letter, such as yours was.</p>
                     <p>Write to me again in my infinite distance.  Tell me about your new book.  No harm in telling <hi rend="italic">me</hi>; I am too far off to be indiscreet; there are too few near me who would care to hear.  I am rushes by the riverside, and the stream is in Babylon: breathe your secrets to me fearlessly; and if the Trade Wind caught and carried them away, there are none to catch them nearer than Australia, unless it were the Tropic Birds.  In the unavoidable absence of my amanuensis, who is buying eels for dinner, I have thus concluded my despatch, like St. Paul, with my own hand.</p>
                     <p>And in the inimitable words of Lord Kames, Faur ye weel, ye bitch.—Yours very truly,</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR BURLINGAME,—In the first place, I have to acknowledge receipt of your munificent cheque for three hundred and fifty dollars.  Glad you liked the Scott voyage; rather more than I did upon the whole.  As the proofs have not turned up at all, there can be no question of returning them, and I am therefore very much pleased to think you have arranged not to wait.  The volumes of Adams arrived along with yours of October 6th.  One of the dictionaries has also blundered home, apparently from the Colonies; the other is still to seek.  I note and sympathise with your bewilderment as to <hi rend="italic">Falesà</hi>.  My own direct correspondence with Mr. Baxter is now about three months in abeyance.  Altogether you see how well it would be if you could do anything to wake up the Post Office.  Not a single copy of the ‘Footnote’ has yet reached Samoa, but I hear of one having come to its address in Hawaii.  Glad to hear good news of Stoddard.—Yours sincerely,</p>
                     <p>R. L. Stevenson.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">P.S.</hi>—Since the above was written an aftermath of post matter came in, among which were the proofs of <hi rend="italic">My Grandfather</hi>.  I shall correct and return them, but as I have lost all confidence in the Post Office, I shall mention here: first galley, 4th line from the bottom, for ‘AS’ read ‘OR.’</p>
                     <p>Should I ever again have to use my work without waiting for proofs, bear in mind this golden principle.  From a congenital defect, I must suppose, I am unable to write the word OR—wherever I write it the printer unerringly puts AS—and those who read for me had better, wherever it is possible, substitute <hi rend="italic">or</hi> for <hi rend="italic">as</hi>.  This the more so since many writers have a habit of using <hi rend="italic">as</hi> which is death to my temper and confusion to my face.</p>

                     <p>DEAR EELES,—In the first place, excuse me writing to you by another hand, as that is the way in which alone all my correspondence gets effected.  Before I took to this method, or rather before I found a victim, it <hi rend="italic">simply</hi> didn’t get effected.</p>
                     <p>Thank you again and again, first for your kind thought of writing to me, and second for your extremely amusing and interesting letter.  You can have no guess how immediately interesting it was to our family.  First of all, the poor soul at Nukufetau is an old friend of ours, and we have actually treated him ourselves on a former visit to the island.  I don’t know if Hoskin would approve of our treatment; it consisted, I believe, mostly in a present of stout and a recommendation to put nails in his water-tank.  We also (as you seem to have done) recommended him to leave the island; and I remember very well how wise and kind we thought his answer.  He had half-caste children (he said) who would suffer and perhaps be despised if he carried them elsewhere; if he left them there alone, they would almost certainly miscarry; and the best thing was that he should stay and die with them.  But the cream of the fun was your meeting with Burn.  We not only know him, but (as the French say) we don’t know anybody else; he is our intimate and adored original; and—prepare your mind—he was, is, and ever will be, Tommy Haddon! <ref target="#6855990405419608431_637-h-3.htm.xhtml#footnote271">[271]</ref>  As I don’t believe you to be inspired, I suspect you to have suspected this.  At least it was a mighty happy suspicion.  You are quite right: Tommy is really ‘a good chap,’ though about as comic as they make them.</p>
                     <p>I was extremely interested in your Fiji legend, and perhaps even more so in your capital account of the <hi rend="italic">Curaçoa’s</hi> misadventure.  Alas! we have nothing so thrilling to relate.  All hangs and fools on in this isle of misgovernment, without change, though not without novelty, but wholly without hope, unless perhaps you should consider it hopeful that I am still more immediately threatened with arrest.  The confounded thing is, that if it comes off, I shall be sent away in the Ringarooma instead of the <hi rend="italic">Curaçoa</hi>.  The former ship burst upon by the run—she had been sent off by despatch and without orders—and to make me a little more easy in my mind she brought newspapers clamouring for my incarceration.  Since then I have had a conversation with the German Consul.  He said he had read a review of my Samoa book, and if the review were fair, must regard it as an insult, and one that would have to be resented.  At the same time, I learn that letters addressed to the German squadron lie for them here in the Post Office.  Reports are current of other English ships being on the way—I hope to goodness yours will be among the number.  And I gather from one thing and another that there must be a holy row going on between the powers at home, and that the issue (like all else connected with Samoa) is on the knees of the gods.  One thing, however, is pretty sure—if that issue prove to be a German Protectorate, I shall have to tramp.  Can you give us any advice as to a fresh field of energy?  We have been searching the atlas, and it seems difficult to fill the bill.  How would Rarotonga do?  I forget if you have been there.  The best of it is that my new house is going up like winking, and I am dictating this letter to the accompaniment of saws and hammers.  A hundred black boys and about a score draught-oxen perished, or at least barely escaped with their lives, from the mud-holes on our road, bringing up the materials.  It will be a fine legacy to H.I.G.M.’s Protectorate, and doubtless the Governor will take it for his country-house.  The Ringarooma people, by the way, seem very nice.  I liked Stansfield particularly.</p>
                     <p>Our middy <ref target="#6855990405419608431_637-h-3.htm.xhtml#footnote272">[272]</ref> has gone up to San Francisco in pursuit of the phantom Education.  We have good word of him, and I hope he will not be in disgrace again, as he was when the hope of the British Navy—need I say that I refer to Admiral Burney?—honoured us last.  The next time you come, as the new house will be finished, we shall be able to offer you a bed.  Nares and Meiklejohn may like to hear that our new room is to be big enough to dance in.  It will be a very pleasant day for me to see the Curaçoa in port again and at least a proper contingent of her officers ‘skipping in my ’all.’</p>
                     <p>We have just had a feast on my birthday at which we had three of the Ringaromas, and I wish they had been three <hi rend="italic">Curaçoas</hi>—say yourself, Hoskin, and Burney the ever Great.  (Consider this an invitation.)  Our boys had got the thing up regardless.  There were two huge sows—oh, brutes of animals that would have broken down a hansom cab—four smaller pigs, two barrels of beef, and a horror of vegetables and fowls.  We sat down between forty and fifty in a big new native house behind the kitchen that you have never seen, and ate and public spoke till all was blue.  Then we had about half an hour’s holiday with some beer and sherry and brandy and soda to restrengthen the European heart, and then out to the old native house to see a siva.  Finally, all the guests were packed off in a trackless black night and down a road that was rather fitted for the <hi rend="italic">Curaçoa</hi> than any human pedestrian, though to be sure I do not know the draught of the <hi rend="italic">Curaçoa</hi>.  My ladies one and all desire to be particularly remembered to our friends on board, and all look forward, as I do myself, in the hope of your return.—Yours sincerely,</p>

                     <p>Also, in case Pitcairn does not come down late enough, I wish as full a report as possible of a Scotch murder trial between 1790–1820.  Understand, <hi rend="italic">the fullest possible</hi>.</p>
                     <p>Is there any book which would guide me as to the following facts?</p>
                     <p>The Justice-Clerk tries some people capitally on circuit.  Certain evidence cropping up, the charge is transferred to the J.-C.’s own son.  Of course, in the next trial the J.-C. is excluded, and the case is called before the Lord-Justice General.</p>
                     <p>Where would this trial have to be?  I fear in Edinburgh, which would not suit my view.  Could it be again at the circuit town?</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR JAMES,—How comes it so great a silence has fallen?  The still small voice of self-approval whispers me it is not from me.  I have looked up my register, and find I have neither written to you nor heard from you since June 22nd, on which day of grace that invaluable work began.  This is not as it should be.  How to get back?  I remember acknowledging with rapture the — of the <hi rend="italic">Master</hi>, and I remember receiving <hi rend="italic">Marbot</hi>: was that our last relation?</p>
                     <p>Hey, well! anyway, as you may have probably gathered from the papers, I have been in devilish hot water, and (what may be new to you) devilish hard at work.  In twelve calendar months I finished <hi rend="italic">The Wrecker</hi>, wrote all of <hi rend="italic">Falesà</hi> but the first chapter (well, much of), the <hi rend="italic">History of Samoa</hi>, did something here and there to my <hi rend="italic">Life of my Grandfather</hi>, and began And Finished <hi rend="italic">David Balfour</hi>.  What do you think of it for a year?  Since then I may say I have done nothing beyond draft three chapters of another novel, <hi rend="italic">The Justice-Clerk</hi>, which ought to be shorter and a blower—at least if it don’t make a spoon, it will spoil the horn of an Aurochs (if that’s how it should be spelt).</p>
                     <p>On the hot water side it may entertain you to know that I have been actually sentenced to deportation by my friends on Mulinuu, C. J. Cedercrantz, and Baron Senfft von Pilsach.  The awful doom, however, declined to fall, owing to Circumstances over Which.  I only heard of it (so to speak) last night.  I mean officially, but I had walked among rumours.  The whole tale will be some day put into my hand, and I shall share it with humorous friends.</p>
                     <p>It is likely, however, by my judgment, that this epoch of gaiety in Samoa will soon cease; and the fierce white light of history will beat no longer on Yours Sincerely and his fellows here on the beach.  We ask ourselves whether the reason will more rejoice over the end of a disgraceful business, or the unregenerate man more sorrow over the stoppage of the fun.  For, say what you please, it has been a deeply interesting time.  You don’t know what news is, nor what politics, nor what the life of man, till you see it on so small a scale and with your own liberty on the board for stake.  I would not have missed it for much.  And anxious friends beg me to stay at home and study human nature in Brompton drawing-rooms!  <hi rend="italic">Farceurs</hi>!  And anyway you know that such is not my talent.  I could never be induced to take the faintest interest in Brompton <hi rend="italic">qua</hi> Brompton or a drawing-room <hi rend="italic">qua</hi> a drawing-room.  I am an Epick Writer with a k to it, but without the necessary genius.</p>
                     <p>Hurry up with another book of stories.  I am now reduced to two of my contemporaries, you and Barrie—O, and Kipling—you and Barrie and Kipling are now my Muses Three.  And with Kipling, as you know, there are reservations to be made.  And you and Barrie don’t write enough.  I should say I also read Anstey when he is serious, and can almost always get a happy day out of Marion Crawford—<hi rend="italic">ce n’est pas toujours la guerre</hi>, but it’s got life to it and guts, and it moves.  Did you read the <hi rend="italic">Witch of Prague</hi>?  Nobody could read it twice, of course; and the first time even it was necessary to skip.  <hi rend="italic">E pur si muove</hi>.  But Barrie is a beauty, the <hi rend="italic">Little Minister</hi> and the <hi rend="italic">Window in Thrums</hi>, eh?  Stuff in that young man; but he must see and not be too funny.  Genius in him, but there’s a journalist at his elbow—there’s the risk.  Look, what a page is the glove business in the <hi rend="italic">Window</hi>! knocks a man flat; that’s guts, if you please.</p>
                     <p>Why have I wasted the little time that is left with a sort of naked review article?  I don’t know, I’m sure.  I suppose a mere ebullition of congested literary talk I am beginning to think a visit from friends would be due.  Wish you could come!</p>
                     <p>Let us have your news anyway, and forgive this silly stale effusion.—Yours ever,</p>

                     <p>DEAR J. M. BARRIE,—You will be sick of me soon; I cannot help it.  I have been off my work for some time, and re-read the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Eleven</hi>, and had a great mind to write a parody and give you all your sauce back again, and see how you would like it yourself.  And then I read (for the first time—I know not how) the <hi rend="italic">Window in Thrums</hi>; I don’t say that it is better than <hi rend="italic">The Minister</hi>; it’s less of a tale—and there is a beauty, a material beauty, of the tale <hi rend="italic">ipse</hi>, which clever critics nowadays long and love to forget; it has more real flaws; but somehow it is—well, I read it last anyway, and it’s by Barrie.  And he’s the man for my money.  The glove is a great page; it is startlingly original, and as true as death and judgment.  Tibbie Birse in the Burial is great, but I think it was a journalist that got in the word ‘official.’  The same character plainly had a word to say to Thomas Haggard.  Thomas affects me as a lie—I beg your pardon; doubtless he was somebody you knew, that leads people so far astray.  The actual is not the true.</p>
                     <p>I am proud to think you are a Scotchman—though to be sure I know nothing of that country, being only an English tourist, quo’ Gavin Ogilvy.  I commend the hard case of Mr. Gavin Ogilvy to J. M. Barrie, whose work is to me a source of living pleasure and heartfelt national pride.  There are two of us now that the Shirra might have patted on the head.  And please do not think when I thus seem to bracket myself with you, that I am wholly blinded with vanity.  Jess is beyond my frontier line; I could not touch her skirt; I have no such glamour of twilight on my pen.  I am a capable artist; but it begins to look to me as if you were a man of genius.  Take care of yourself, for my sake.  It’s a devilish hard thing for a man who writes so many novels as I do, that I should get so few to read.  And I can read yours, and I love them.</p>
                     <p>A pity for you that my amanuensis is not on stock to-day, and my own hand perceptibly worse than usual.—Yours,</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">P.S.</hi>—They tell me your health is not strong.  Man, come out here and try the Prophet’s chamber.  There’s only one bad point to us—we do rise early.  The Amanuensis states that you are a lover of silence—and that ours is a noisy house—and she is a chatterbox—I am not answerable for these statements, though I do think there is a touch of garrulity about my premises.  We have so little to talk about, you see.  The house is three miles from town, in the midst of great silent forests.  There is a burn close by, and when we are not talking you can hear the burn, and the birds, and the sea breaking on the coast three miles away and six hundred feet below us, and about three times a month a bell—I don’t know where the bell is, nor who rings it; it may be the bell in Hans Andersen’s story for all I know.  It is never hot here—86 in the shade is about our hottest—and it is never cold except just in the early mornings.  Take it for all in all, I suppose this island climate to be by far the healthiest in the world—even the influenza entirely lost its sting.  Only two patients died, and one was a man nearly eighty, and the other a child below four months.  I won’t tell you if it is beautiful, for I want you to come here and see for yourself.  Everybody on the premises except my wife has some Scotch blood in their veins—I beg your pardon—except the natives—and then my wife is a Dutchwoman—and the natives are the next thing conceivable to Highlanders before the forty-five.  We would have some grand cracks!</p>

                     <p>. . . About <hi rend="italic">The Justice-Clerk</hi>, I long to go at it, but will first try to get a short story done.  Since January I have had two severe illnesses, my boy, and some heart-breaking anxiety over Fanny; and am only now convalescing.  I came down to dinner last night for the first time, and that only because the service had broken down, and to relieve an inexperienced servant.  Nearly four months now I have rested my brains; and if it be true that rest is good for brains, I ought to be able to pitch in like a giant refreshed.  Before the autumn, I hope to send you some <hi rend="italic">Justice-Clerk</hi>, or <hi rend="italic">Weir of Hermiston</hi>, as Colvin seems to prefer; I own to indecision.  Received <hi rend="italic">Syntax</hi>, <hi rend="italic">Dance of Death</hi>, and <hi rend="italic">Pitcairn</hi>, which last I have read from end to end since its arrival, with vast improvement.  What a pity it stops so soon!  I wonder is there nothing that seems to prolong the series?  Why doesn’t some young man take it up?  How about my old friend Fountainhall’s <hi rend="italic">Decisions</hi>?  I remember as a boy that there was some good reading there.  Perhaps you could borrow me that, and send it on loan; and perhaps Laing’s <hi rend="italic">Memorials</hi> therewith; and a work I’m ashamed to say I have never read, <hi rend="italic">Balfour’s Letters</hi>. . . . I have come by accident, through a correspondent, on one very curious and interesting fact—namely, that Stevenson was one of the names adopted by the MacGregors at the proscription.  The details supplied by my correspondent are both convincing and amusing; but it would be highly interesting to find out more of this.</p>

                     <p>DEAR SIR,—You have taken many occasions to make yourself very agreeable to me, for which I might in decency have thanked you earlier.  It is now my turn; and I hope you will allow me to offer you my compliments on your very ingenious and very interesting adventures of Sherlock Holmes.  That is the class of literature that I like when I have the toothache.  As a matter of fact, it was a pleurisy I was enjoying when I took the volume up; and it will interest you as a medical man to know that the cure was for the moment effectual.  Only the one thing troubles me: can this be my old friend Joe Bell?—I am, yours very truly,</p>

                     <p>DEAR MR. CROCKETT,—I do not owe you two letters, nor yet nearly one, sir!  The last time I heard of you, you wrote about an accident, and I sent you a letter to my lawyer, Charles Baxter, which does not seem to have been presented, as I see nothing of it in his accounts.  Query, was that lost?  I should not like you to think I had been so unmannerly and so inhuman.  If you have written since, your letter also has miscarried, as is much the rule in this part of the world, unless you register.</p>
                     <p>Your book is not yet to hand, but will probably follow next month.  I detected you early in the <hi rend="italic">Bookman</hi>, which I usually see, and noted you in particular as displaying a monstrous ingratitude about the footnote.  Well, mankind is ungrateful; ‘Man’s ingratitude to man makes countless thousands mourn,’ quo’ Rab—or words to that effect.  By the way, an anecdote of a cautious sailor: ‘Bill, Bill,’ says I to him, ‘<hi rend="italic">or words to that effect</hi>.’</p>
                     <p>I shall never take that walk by the Fisher’s Tryst and Glencorse.  I shall never see Auld Reekie.  I shall never set my foot again upon the heather.  Here I am until I die, and here will I be buried.  The word is out and the doom written.  Or, if I do come, it will be a voyage to a further goal, and in fact a suicide; which, however, if I could get my family all fixed up in the money way, I might, perhaps, perform, or attempt.  But there is a plaguey risk of breaking down by the way; and I believe I shall stay here until the end comes like a good boy, as I am.  If I did it, I should put upon my trunks: ‘Passenger to—Hades.’  How strangely wrong your information is!  In the first place, I should never carry a novel to Sydney; I should post it from here.  In the second place, <hi rend="italic">Weir of Hermiston</hi> is as yet scarce begun.  It’s going to be excellent, no doubt; but it consists of about twenty pages.  I have a tale, a shortish tale in length, but it has proved long to do, <hi rend="italic">The Ebb Tide</hi>, some part of which goes home this mail.  It is by me and Mr. Osbourne, and is really a singular work.  There are only four characters, and three of them are bandits—well, two of them are, and the third is their comrade and accomplice.  It sounds cheering, doesn’t it?  Barratry, and drunkenness, and vitriol, and I cannot tell you all what, are the beams of the roof.  And yet—I don’t know—I sort of think there’s something in it.  You’ll see (which is more than I ever can) whether Davis and Attwater come off or not.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Weir of Hermiston</hi> is a much greater undertaking, and the plot is not good, I fear; but Lord Justice-Clerk Hermiston ought to be a plum.  Of other schemes, more or less executed, it skills not to speak.</p>
                     <p>I am glad to hear so good an account of your activity and interests, and shall always hear from you with pleasure; though I am, and must continue, a mere sprite of the inkbottle, unseen in the flesh.  Please remember me to your wife and to the four-year-old sweetheart, if she be not too engrossed with higher matters.  Do you know where the road crosses the burn under Glencorse Church?  Go there, and say a prayer for me: <hi rend="italic">moriturus salutat</hi>.  See that it’s a sunny day; I would like it to be a Sunday, but that’s not possible in the premises; and stand on the right-hand bank just where the road goes down into the water, and shut your eyes, and if I don’t appear to you! well, it can’t be helped, and will be extremely funny.</p>
                     <p>I have no concern here but to work and to keep an eye on this distracted people.  I live just now wholly alone in an upper room of my house, because the whole family are down with influenza, bar my wife and myself.  I get my horse up sometimes in the afternoon and have a ride in the woods; and I sit here and smoke and write, and rewrite, and destroy, and rage at my own impotence, from six in the morning till eight at night, with trifling and not always agreeable intervals for meals.</p>
                     <p>I am sure you chose wisely to keep your country charge.  There a minister can be something, not in a town.  In a town, the most of them are empty houses—and public speakers.  Why should you suppose your book will be slated because you have no friends?  A new writer, if he is any good, will be acclaimed generally with more noise than he deserves.  But by this time you will know for certain.—I am, yours sincerely,</p>
                     <p>Robert Louis Stevenson.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">P.S.</hi>—Be it known to this fluent generation that I R. L. S., in the forty-third of my age and the twentieth of my professional life, wrote twenty-four pages in twenty-one days, working from six to eleven, and again in the afternoon from two to four or so, without fail or interruption.  Such are the gifts the gods have endowed us withal: such was the facility of this prolific writer!</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR GOD-LIKE SCULPTOR,—I wish in the most delicate manner in the world to insinuate a few commissions:—</p>
                     <p>No. 1. Is for a couple of copies of my medallion, as gilt-edged and high-toned as it is possible to make them.  One is for our house here, and should be addressed as above.  The other is for my friend Sidney Colvin, and should be addressed—Sidney Colvin, Esq., Keeper of the Print Room, British Museum, London.</p>
                     <p>No. 2. This is a rather large order, and demands some explanation.  Our house is lined with varnished wood of a dark ruddy colour, very beautiful to see; at the same time, it calls very much for gold; there is a limit to picture frames, and really you know there has to be a limit to the pictures you put inside of them.  Accordingly, we have had an idea of a certain kind of decoration, which, I think, you might help us to make practical.  What we want is an alphabet of gilt letters (very much such as people play with), and all mounted on spikes like drawing-pins; say two spikes to each letter, one at top, and one at bottom.  Say that they were this height, <figure>

                        </figure> and that you chose a model of some really exquisitely fine, clear type from some Roman monument, and that they were made either of metal or some composition gilt—the point is, could not you, in your land of wooden houses, get a manufacturer to take the idea and manufacture them at a venture, so that I could get two or three hundred pieces or so at a moderate figure?  You see, suppose you entertain an honoured guest, when he goes he leaves his name in gilt letters on your walls; an infinity of fun and decoration can be got out of hospitable and festive mottoes; and the doors of every room can be beautified by the legend of their names.  I really think there is something in the idea, and you might be able to push it with the brutal and licentious manufacturer, using my name if necessary, though I should think the name of the god-like sculptor would be more germane.  In case you should get it started, I should tell you that we should require commas in order to write the Samoan language, which is full of words written thus: la’u, ti’e ti’e.  As the Samoan language uses but a very small proportion of the consonants, we should require a double or treble stock of all vowels and of F, G, L, U, N, P, S, T, and V.</p>
                     <p>The other day in Sydney, I think you might be interested to hear, I was sculpt a second time by a man called —, as well as I can remember and read.  I mustn’t criticise a present, and he had very little time to do it in.  It is thought by my family to be an excellent likeness of Mark Twain.  This poor fellow, by the by, met with the devil of an accident.  A model of a statue which he had just finished with a desperate effort was smashed to smithereens on its way to exhibition.</p>
                     <p>Please be sure and let me know if anything is likely to come of this letter business, and the exact cost of each letter, so that I may count the cost before ordering.—Yours sincerely,</p>

                        <hi rend="italic">June</hi> 10<hi rend="italic">th</hi>, 1893.</p>
                     <p>MY DEAR GOSSE,—My mother tells me you never received the very long and careful letter that I sent you more than a year ago; or is it two years?</p>
                     <p>I was indeed so much surprised at your silence that I wrote to Henry James and begged him to inquire if you had received it; his reply was an (if possible) higher power of the same silence; whereupon I bowed my head and acquiesced.  But there is no doubt the letter was written and sent; and I am sorry it was lost, for it contained, among other things, an irrecoverable criticism of your father’s <hi rend="italic">Life</hi>, with a number of suggestions for another edition, which struck me at the time as excellent.</p>
                     <p>Well, suppose we call that cried off, and begin as before?  It is fortunate indeed that we can do so, being both for a while longer in the day.  But, alas! when I see ‘works of the late J. A. S.,’ <ref target="#6855990405419608431_637-h-3.htm.xhtml#footnote292">[292]</ref>  I can see no help and no reconciliation possible.  I wrote him a letter, I think, three years ago, heard in some roundabout way that he had received it, waited in vain for an answer (which had probably miscarried), and in a humour between frowns and smiles wrote to him no more.  And now the strange, poignant, pathetic, brilliant creature is gone into the night, and the voice is silent that uttered so much excellent discourse; and I am sorry that I did not write to him again.  Yet I am glad for him; light lie the turf!  The <hi rend="italic">Saturday</hi> is the only obituary I have seen, and I thought it very good upon the whole.  I should be half tempted to write an <hi rend="italic">In Memoriam</hi>, but I am submerged with other work.  Are you going to do it?  I very much admire your efforts that way; you are our only academician.</p>
                     <p>So you have tried fiction?  I will tell you the truth: when I saw it announced, I was so sure you would send it to me, that I did not order it!  But the order goes this mail, and I will give you news of it.  Yes, honestly, fiction is very difficult; it is a terrible strain to <hi rend="italic">carry</hi> your characters all that time.  And the difficulty of according the narrative and the dialogue (in a work in the third person) is extreme.  That is one reason out of half a dozen why I so often prefer the first.  It is much in my mind just now, because of my last work, just off the stocks three days ago, <hi rend="italic">The Ebb Tide</hi>: a dreadful, grimy business in the third person, where the strain between a vilely realistic dialogue and a narrative style pitched about (in phrase) ‘four notes higher’ than it should have been, has sown my head with grey hairs; or I believe so—if my head escaped, my heart has them.</p>
                     <p>The truth is, I have a little lost my way, and stand bemused at the cross-roads.  A subject?  Ay, I have dozens; I have at least four novels begun, they are none good enough; and the mill waits, and I’ll have to take second best.  <hi rend="italic">The Ebb Tide</hi> I make the world a present of; I expect, and, I suppose, deserve to be torn to pieces; but there was all that good work lying useless, and I had to finish it!</p>
                     <p>All your news of your family is pleasant to hear.  My wife has been very ill, but is now better; I may say I am ditto, <hi rend="italic">The Ebb Tide</hi> having left me high and dry, which is a good example of the mixed metaphor.  Our home, and estate, and our boys, and the politics of the island, keep us perpetually amused and busy; and I grind away with an odd, dogged, down sensation—and an idea <hi rend="italic">in petto</hi> that the game is about played out.  I have got too realistic, and I must break the trammels—I mean I would if I could; but the yoke is heavy.  I saw with amusement that Zola says the same thing; and truly the <hi rend="italic">Débâcle</hi> was a mighty big book, I have no need for a bigger, though the last part is a mere mistake in my opinion.  But the Emperor, and Sedan, and the doctor at the ambulance, and the horses in the field of battle, Lord, how gripped it is!  What an epical performance!  According to my usual opinion, I believe I could go over that book and leave a masterpiece by blotting and no ulterior art.  But that is an old story, ever new with me.  Taine gone, and Renan, and Symonds, and Tennyson, and Browning; the suns go swiftly out, and I see no suns to follow, nothing but a universal twilight of the demi-divinities, with parties like you and me and Lang beating on toy drums and playing on penny whistles about glow-worms.  But Zola is big anyway; he has plenty in his belly; too much, that is all; he wrote the <hi rend="italic">Débâcle</hi> and he wrote <hi rend="italic">La Bête humaine</hi>, perhaps the most excruciatingly silly book that I ever read to an end.  And why did I read it to an end, W. E. G.?  Because the animal in me was interested in the lewdness.  Not sincerely, of course, my mind refusing to partake in it; but the flesh was slightly pleased.  And when it was done, I cast it from me with a peal of laughter, and forgot it, as I would forget a Montépin.  Taine is to me perhaps the chief of these losses; I did luxuriate in his <hi rend="italic">Origines</hi>; it was something beyond literature, not quite so good, if you please, but so much more systematic, and the pages that had to be ‘written’ always so adequate.  Robespierre, Napoleon, were both excellent good.</p>

                     <p>Well, I have left fiction wholly, and gone to my <hi rend="italic">Grandfather</hi>, and on the whole found peace.  By next month my <hi rend="italic">Grandfather</hi> will begin to be quite grown up.  I have already three chapters about as good as done; by which, of course, as you know, I mean till further notice or the next discovery.  I like biography far better than fiction myself: fiction is too free.  In biography you have your little handful of facts, little bits of a puzzle, and you sit and think, and fit ’em together this way and that, and get up and throw ’em down, and say damn, and go out for a walk.  And it’s real soothing; and when done, gives an idea of finish to the writer that is very peaceful.  Of course, it’s not really so finished as quite a rotten novel; it always has and always must have the incurable illogicalities of life about it, the fathoms of slack and the miles of tedium.  Still, that’s where the fun comes in; and when you have at last managed to shut up the castle spectre (dulness), the very outside of his door looks beautiful by contrast.  There are pages in these books that may seem nothing to the reader; but you <hi rend="italic">remember what they were</hi>, <hi rend="italic">you know what they might have been</hi>, and they seem to you witty beyond comparison.  In my <hi rend="italic">Grandfather</hi> I’ve had (for instance) to give up the temporal order almost entirely; doubtless the temporal order is the great foe of the biographer; it is so tempting, so easy, and lo! there you are in the bog!—Ever yours,</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR HENRY JAMES,—I believe I have neglected a mail in answering yours.  You will be very sorry to hear that my wife was exceedingly ill, and very glad to hear that she is better.  I cannot say that I feel any more anxiety about her.  We shall send you a photograph of her taken in Sydney in her customary island habit as she walks and gardens and shrilly drills her brown assistants.  She was very ill when she sat for it, which may a little explain the appearance of the photograph.  It reminds me of a friend of my grandmother’s who used to say when talking to younger women, ‘Aweel, when I was young, I wasnae just exactly what ye wad call <hi rend="italic">bonny</hi>, but I was pale, penetratin’, and interestin’.’  I would not venture to hint that Fanny is ‘no bonny,’ but there is no doubt but that in this presentment she is ‘pale, penetratin’, and interesting.’</p>
                     <p>As you are aware, I have been wading deep waters and contending with the great ones of the earth, not wholly without success.  It is, you may be interested to hear, a dreary and infuriating business.  If you can get the fools to admit one thing, they will always save their face by denying another.  If you can induce them to take a step to the right hand, they generally indemnify themselves by cutting a caper to the left.  I always held (upon no evidence whatever, from a mere sentiment or intuition) that politics was the dirtiest, the most foolish, and the most random of human employments.  I always held, but now I know it!  Fortunately, you have nothing to do with anything of the kind, and I may spare you the horror of further details.</p>
                     <p>I received from you a book by a man by the name of Anatole France.  Why should I disguise it?  I have no use for Anatole.  He writes very prettily, and then afterwards?  Baron Marbot was a different pair of shoes.  So likewise is the Baron de Vitrolles, whom I am now perusing with delight.  His escape in 1814 is one of the best pages I remember anywhere to have read.  But Marbot and Vitrolles are dead, and what has become of the living?  It seems as if literature were coming to a stand.  I am sure it is with me; and I am sure everybody will say so when they have the privilege of reading <hi rend="italic">The Ebb Tide</hi>.  My dear man, the grimness of that story is not to be depicted in words.  There are only four characters, to be sure, but they are such a troop of swine!  And their behaviour is really so deeply beneath any possible standard, that on a retrospect I wonder I have been able to endure them myself until the yarn was finished.  Well, there is always one thing; it will serve as a touchstone.  If the admirers of Zola admire him for his pertinent ugliness and pessimism, I think they should admire this; but if, as I have long suspected, they neither admire nor understand the man’s art, and only wallow in his rancidness like a hound in offal, then they will certainly be disappointed in <hi rend="italic">The Ebb Tide</hi>.  <hi rend="italic">Alas</hi>! poor little tale, it is not <hi rend="italic">even</hi> rancid.</p>
                     <p>By way of an antidote or febrifuge, I am going on at a great rate with my <hi rend="italic">History of the Stevensons</hi>, which I hope may prove rather amusing, in some parts at least.  The excess of materials weighs upon me.  My grandfather is a delightful comedy part; and I have to treat him besides as a serious and (in his way) a heroic figure, and at times I lose my way, and I fear in the end will blur the effect.  However, <hi rend="italic">à la grâce de Dieu</hi>!  I’ll make a spoon or spoil a horn.  You see, I have to do the Building of the Bell Rock by cutting down and packing my grandsire’s book, which I rather hope I have done, but do not know.  And it makes a huge chunk of a very different style and quality between Chapters II. and IV.  And it can’t be helped!  It is just a delightful and exasperating necessity.  You know, the stuff is really excellent narrative: only, perhaps there’s too much of it!  There is the rub.  Well, well, it will be plain to you that my mind is affected; it might be with less.  <hi rend="italic">The Ebb Tide</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Northern Lights</hi> are a full meal for any plain man.</p>
                     <p>I have written and ordered your last book, <hi rend="italic">The Real Thing</hi>, so be sure and don’t send it.  What else are you doing or thinking of doing?  News I have none, and don’t want any.  I have had to stop all strong drink and all tobacco, and am now in a transition state between the two, which seems to be near madness.  You never smoked, I think, so you can never taste the joys of stopping it.  But at least you have drunk, and you can enter perhaps into my annoyance when I suddenly find a glass of claret or a brandy-and-water give me a splitting headache the next morning.  No mistake about it; drink anything, and there’s your headache.  Tobacco just as bad for me.  If I live through this breach of habit, I shall be a white-livered puppy indeed.  Actually I am so made, or so twisted, that I do not like to think of a life without the red wine on the table and the tobacco with its lovely little coal of fire.  It doesn’t amuse me from a distance.  I may find it the Garden of Eden when I go in, but I don’t like the colour of the gate-posts.  Suppose somebody said to you, you are to leave your home, and your books, and your clubs, and go out and camp in mid-Africa, and command an expedition, you would howl, and kick, and flee.  I think the same of a life without wine and tobacco; and if this goes on, I’ve got to go and do it, sir, in the living flesh!</p>
                     <p>I thought Bourget was a friend of yours?  And I thought the French were a polite race?  He has taken my dedication with a stately silence that has surprised me into apoplexy.  Did I go and dedicate my book <ref target="#6855990405419608431_637-h-3.htm.xhtml#footnote298a">[298a]</ref> to the nasty alien, and the ’norrid Frenchman, and the Bloody Furrineer?  Well, I wouldn’t do it again; and unless his case is susceptible of explanation, you might perhaps tell him so over the walnuts and the wine, by way of speeding the gay hours.  Sincerely, I thought my dedication worth a letter.</p>
                     <p>If anything be worth anything here below!  Do you know the story of the man who found a button in his hash, and called the waiter?  ‘What do you call that?’ says he.  ‘Well,’ said the waiter, ‘what d’you expect?  Expect to find a gold watch and chain?’  Heavenly apologue, is it not?  I expected (rather) to find a gold watch and chain; I expected to be able to smoke to excess and drink to comfort all the days of my life; and I am still indignantly staring on this button!  It’s not even a button; it’s a teetotal badge!—Ever yours,</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR HENRY JAMES,—Yes.  <hi rend="italic">Les Trophées</hi>, on the whole, a book. <ref target="#6855990405419608431_637-h-3.htm.xhtml#footnote298b">[298b]</ref>  It is excellent; but is it a life’s work?  I always suspect <hi rend="italic">you</hi> of a volume of sonnets up your sleeve; when is it coming down?  I am in one of my moods of wholesale impatience with all fiction and all verging on it, reading instead, with rapture, <hi rend="italic">Fountainhall’s Decisions</hi>.  You never read it: well, it hasn’t much form, and is inexpressibly dreary, I should suppose, to others—and even to me for pages.  It’s like walking in a mine underground, and with a damned bad lantern, and picking out pieces of ore.  This, and war, will be my excuse for not having read your (doubtless) charming work of fiction.  The revolving year will bring me round to it; and I know, when fiction shall begin to feel a little <hi rend="italic">solid</hi> to me again, that I shall love it, because it’s James.  Do you know, when I am in this mood, I would rather try to read a bad book?  It’s not so disappointing, anyway.  And <hi rend="italic">Fountainhall</hi> is prime, two big folio volumes, and all dreary, and all true, and all as terse as an obituary; and about one interesting fact on an average in twenty pages, and ten of them unintelligible for technicalities.  There’s literature, if you like!  It feeds; it falls about you genuine like rain.  Rain: nobody has done justice to rain in literature yet: surely a subject for a Scot.  But then you can’t do rain in that ledger-book style that I am trying for—or between a ledger-book and an old ballad.  How to get over, how to escape from, the besotting <hi rend="italic">particularity</hi> of fiction.  ‘Roland approached the house; it had green doors and window blinds; and there was a scraper on the upper step.’  To hell with Roland and the scraper!—Yours ever,</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR DR. CONAN DOYLE,—The <hi rend="italic">White Company</hi> has not yet turned up; but when it does—which I suppose will be next mail—you shall hear news of me.  I have a great talent for compliment, accompanied by a hateful, even a diabolic frankness.</p>
                     <p>Delighted to hear I have a chance of seeing you and Mrs. Doyle; Mrs. Stevenson bids me say (what is too true) that our rations are often spare.  Are you Great Eaters?  Please reply.</p>
                     <p>As to ways and means, here is what you will have to do.  Leave San Francisco by the down mail, get off at Samoa, and twelve days or a fortnight later, you can continue your journey to Auckland per Upolu, which will give you a look at Tonga and possibly Fiji by the way.  Make this a <hi rend="italic">first part of your plans</hi>.  A fortnight, even of Vailima diet, could kill nobody.</p>
                     <p>We are in the midst of war here; rather a nasty business, with the head-taking; and there seem signs of other trouble.  But I believe you need make no change in your design to visit us.  All should be well over; and if it were not, why! you need not leave the steamer.—Yours very truly,</p>

                     <p>My dear old man, I perceive by a thousand signs that we grow old, and are soon to pass away!  I hope with dignity; if not, with courage at least.  I am myself very ready; or would be—will be—when I have made a little money for my folks.  The blows that have fallen upon you are truly terrifying; I wish you strength to bear them.  It is strange, I must seem to you to blaze in a Birmingham prosperity and happiness; and to myself I seem a failure.  The truth is, I have never got over the last influenza yet, and am miserably out of heart and out of kilter.  Lungs pretty right, stomach nowhere, spirits a good deal overshadowed; but we’ll come through it yet, and cock our bonnets.  (I confess with sorrow that I am not yet quite sure about the <hi rend="italic">intellects</hi>; but I hope it is only one of my usual periods of non-work.  They are more unbearable now, because I cannot rest.  <hi rend="italic">No rest but the grave for Sir Walter</hi>!  O the words ring in a man’s head.)</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR DR.

Murat very good; Louis XIV. and Louvois with the letter bag very rich.  You have reached a trifle wide perhaps; too <hi rend="italic">many</hi> celebrities?  Though I was delighted to re-encounter my old friend Du Chaylu.  Old Murat is perhaps your high water mark; ’tis excellently human, cheerful and real.  Do it again.  Madame de Maintenon struck me as quite good.  Have you any document for the decapitation?  It sounds steepish.  The devil of all that first part is that you see old Dumas; yet your Louis XIV. is <hi rend="italic">distinctly good</hi>.  I am much interested with this book, which fulfils a good deal, and promises more.  Question: How far a Historical Novel should be wholly episodic?  I incline to that view, with trembling.  I shake hands with you on old Murat.</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR MEREDITH,—I have again and again taken up the pen to write to you, and many beginnings have gone into the waste paper basket (I have one now—for the second time in my life—and feel a big man on the strength of it).  And no doubt it requires some decision to break so long a silence.  My health is vastly restored, and I am now living patriarchally in this place six hundred feet above the sea on the shoulder of a mountain of 1500.  Behind me, the unbroken bush slopes up to the backbone of the island (3 to 4000) without a house, with no inhabitants save a few runaway black boys, wild pigs and cattle, and wild doves and flying foxes, and many parti-coloured birds, and many black, and many white: a very eerie, dim, strange place and hard to travel.  I am the head of a household of five whites, and of twelve Samoans, to all of whom I am the chief and father: my cook comes to me and asks leave to marry—and his mother, a fine old chief woman, who has never lived here, does the same.  You may be sure I granted the petition.  It is a life of great interest, complicated by the Tower of Babel, that old enemy.  And I have all the time on my hands for literary work.  My house is a great place; we have a hall fifty feet long with a great red-wood stair ascending from it, where we dine in state—myself usually dressed in a singlet and a pair of trousers—and attended on by servants in a single garment, a kind of kilt—also flowers and leaves—and their hair often powdered with lime.  The European who came upon it suddenly would think it was a dream.  We have prayers on Sunday night—I am a perfect pariah in the island not to have them oftener, but the spirit is unwilling and the flesh proud, and I cannot go it more.  It is strange to see the long line of the brown folk crouched along the wall with lanterns at intervals before them in the big shadowy hall, with an oak cabinet at one end of it and a group of Rodin’s (which native taste regards as <hi rend="italic">prodigieusement leste</hi>) presiding over all from the top—and to hear the long rambling Samoan hymn rolling up (God bless me, what style!  But I am off business to-day, and this is not meant to be literature.).</p>
                     <p>I have asked Colvin to send you a copy of <hi rend="italic">Catriona</hi>, which I am sometimes tempted to think is about my best work.  I hear word occasionally of the <hi rend="italic">Amazing Marriage</hi>.  It will be a brave day for me when I get hold of it.  Gower Woodseer is now an ancient, lean, grim, exiled Scot, living and labouring as for a wager in the tropics; still active, still with lots of fire in him, but the youth—ah, the youth where is it?  For years after I came here, the critics (those genial gentlemen) used to deplore the relaxation of my fibre and the idleness to which I had succumbed.  I hear less of this now; the next thing is they will tell me I am writing myself out! and that my unconscientious conduct is bringing their grey hairs with sorrow to the dust.  I do not know—I mean I do know one thing.  For fourteen years I have not had a day’s real health; I have wakened sick and gone to bed weary; and I have done my work unflinchingly.  I have written in bed, and written out of it, written in hemorrhages, written in sickness, written torn by coughing, written when my head swam for weakness; and for so long, it seems to me I have won my wager and recovered my glove.  I am better now, have been rightly speaking since first I came to the Pacific; and still, few are the days when I am not in some physical distress.  And the battle goes on—ill or well, is a trifle; so as it goes.  I was made for a contest, and the Powers have so willed that my battlefield should be this dingy, inglorious one of the bed and the physic bottle.  At least I have not failed, but I would have preferred a place of trumpetings and the open air over my head.</p>
                     <p>This is a devilish egotistical yarn.  Will you try to imitate me in that if the spirit ever moves you to reply?  And meantime be sure that away in the midst of the Pacific there is a house on a wooded island where the name of George Meredith is very dear, and his memory (since it must be no more) is continually honoured.—Ever your friend,</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR ST. GAUDENS,—I had determined not to write to you till I had seen the medallion, but it looks as if that might mean the Greek Kalends or the day after to-morrow.  Reassure yourself, your part is done, it is ours that halts—the consideration of conveyance over our sweet little road on boys’ backs, for we cannot very well apply the horses to this work; there is only one; you cannot put it in a panier; to put it on the horse’s back we have not the heart.  Beneath the beauty of R. L. S., to say nothing of his verses, which the publishers find heavy enough, and the genius of the god-like sculptor, the spine would snap and the well-knit limbs of the (ahem) cart-horse would be loosed by death.  So you are to conceive me, sitting in my house, dubitative, and the medallion chuckling in the warehouse of the German firm, for some days longer; and hear me meanwhile on the golden letters.</p>
                     <p>Alas! they are all my fancy painted, but the price is prohibitive.  I cannot do it.  It is another day-dream burst.  Another gable of Abbotsford has gone down, fortunately before it was builded, so there’s nobody injured—except me.  I had a strong conviction that I was a great hand at writing inscriptions, and meant to exhibit and test my genius on the walls of my house; and now I see I can’t.  It is generally thus.  The Battle of the Golden Letters will never be delivered.  On making preparation to open the campaign, the King found himself face to face with invincible difficulties, in which the rapacity of a mercenary soldiery and the complaints of an impoverished treasury played an equal part.—Ever yours,</p>
                     <p>Robert Louis Stevenson.</p>
                     <p>I enclose a bill for the medallion; have been trying to find your letter, quite in vain, and therefore must request you to pay for the bronze letters yourself and let me know the damage.</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR STEVENSON,—A thousand thanks for your voluminous and delightful collections.  Baxter—so soon as it is ready—will let you see a proof of my introduction, which is only sent out as a sprat to catch whales.  And you will find I have a good deal of what you have, only mine in a perfectly desultory manner, as is necessary to an exile.  My uncle’s pedigree is wrong; there was never a Stevenson of Caldwell, of course, but they were tenants of the Muirs; the farm held by them is in my introduction; and I have already written to Charles Baxter to have a search made in the Register House.  I hope he will have had the inspiration to put it under your surveillance.  Your information as to your own family is intensely interesting, and I should not wonder but what you and we and old John Stevenson, ‘land labourer in the parish of Dailly,’ came all of the same stock.  Ayrshire—and probably Cunningham—seems to be the home of the race—our part of it.  From the distribution of the name—which your collections have so much extended without essentially changing my knowledge of—we seem rather pointed to a British origin.  What you say of the Engineers is fresh to me, and must be well thrashed out.  This introduction of it will take a long while to walk about!—as perhaps I may be tempted to let it become long; after all, I am writing <hi rend="italic">this</hi> for my own pleasure solely.  Greetings to you and other Speculatives of our date, long bygone, alas!—Yours very sincerely,</p>

                     <p>DEAR JOHNNIE,—Well, I must say you seem to be a tremendous fellow!  Before I was eight I used to write stories—or dictate them at least—and I had produced an excellent history of Moses, for which I got £1 from an uncle; but I had never gone the length of a play, so you have beaten me fairly on my own ground.  I hope you may continue to do so, and thanking you heartily for your nice letter, I shall beg you to believe me yours truly,</p>

                     <p>DEAR RUSSELL,—I have to thank you very much for your capital letter, which came to hand here in Samoa along with your mother’s.  When you ‘grow up and write stories like me,’ you will be able to understand that there is scarce anything more painful than for an author to hold a pen; he has to do it so much that his heart sickens and his fingers ache at the sight or touch of it; so that you will excuse me if I do not write much, but remain (with compliments and greetings from one Scot to another—though I was not born in Ceylon—you’re ahead of me there).—Yours very truly,</p>

                     <p>MY DEAREST CUMMY,—This goes to you with a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year.  The Happy New Year anyway, for I think it should reach you about <hi rend="italic">Noor’s Day</hi>.  I dare say it may be cold and frosty.  Do you remember when you used to take me out of bed in the early morning, carry me to the back windows, show me the hills of Fife, and quote to me.</p>
                     <p>‘A’ the hills are covered wi’ snaw,<lb/>   An’ winter’s noo come fairly’?</p>
                     <p>There is not much chance of that here!  I wonder how my mother is going to stand the winter.  If she can, it will be a very good thing for her.  We are in that part of the year which I like the best—the Rainy or Hurricane Season.  ‘When it is good, it is very, very good; and when it is bad, it is horrid,’ and our fine days are certainly fine like heaven; such a blue of the sea, such green of the trees, and such crimson of the hibiscus flowers, you never saw; and the air as mild and gentle as a baby’s breath, and yet not hot!</p>
                     <p>The mail is on the move, and I must let up.—With much love, I am, your laddie,</p>

                     <p>‘<hi rend="italic">October</hi> 25, 1685.—At Privy Council, George Murray, Lieutenant of the King’s Guard, and others, did, on the 21st of September last, obtain a clandestine order of Privy Council to apprehend the person of Janet Pringle, daughter to the late Clifton, and she having retired out of the way upon information, he got an order against Andrew Pringle, her uncle, to produce her. . . . But she having married Andrew Pringle, her uncle’s son (to disappoint all their designs of selling her), a boy of thirteen years old.’  But my boy is to be fourteen, so I extract no further.—Fountainhall, i. 320.</p>

                     <p> </p>
                     <p>MY DEAR CHARLES,—The above is my story, and I wonder if any light can be thrown on it.  I prefer the girl’s father dead; and the question is, How in that case could Lieutenant George Murray get his order to ‘apprehend’ and his power to ‘sell’ her in marriage?</p>
                     <p>Or—might Lieutenant G. be her tutor, and she fugitive to the Pringles, and on the discovery of her whereabouts hastily married?</p>
                     <p>A good legal note on these points is very ardently desired by me; it will be the corner-stone of my novel.</p>
                     <p>This is for—I am quite wrong to tell you—for you will tell others—and nothing will teach you that all my schemes are in the air, and vanish and reappear again like shapes in the clouds—it is for <hi rend="italic">Heathercat</hi>: whereof the first volume will be called <hi rend="italic">The Killing Time</hi>, and I believe I have authorities ample for that.  But the second volume is to be called (I believe) <hi rend="italic">Darien</hi>, and for that I want, I fear, a good deal of truck:—</p>

                     <p>I hope may do me.  Some sort of general history of the Darien affair (if there is a decent one, which I misdoubt), it would also be well to have—the one with most details, if possible.  It is singular how obscure to me this decade of Scots history remains, 1690–1700—a deuce of a want of light and grouping to it!  However, I believe I shall be mostly out of Scotland in my tale; first in Carolina, next in Darien.  I want also—I am the daughter of the horse-leech truly—‘Black’s new large map of Scotland,’ sheets 3, 4, and 5, a 7s. 6d. touch.  I believe, if you can get the</p>

                     <p>they had better come also; and if there be any reasonable work—but no, I must call a halt. . . .</p>
                     <p>I fear the song looks doubtful, but I’ll consider of it, and I can promise you some reminiscences which it will amuse me to write, whether or not it will amuse the public to read of them.  But it’s an unco business to <hi rend="italic">supply</hi> deid-heid coapy.</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR BARRIE,—I have received duly the <hi rend="italic">magnum opus</hi>, and it really is a <hi rend="italic">magnum opus</hi>. <ref target="#6855990405419608431_637-h-3.htm.xhtml#footnote311">[311]</ref>  It is a beautiful specimen of Clark’s printing, paper sufficient, and the illustrations all my fancy painted.  But the particular flower of the flock to whom I have hopelessly lost my heart is Tibby Birse.  I must have known Tibby Birse when she was a servant’s mantua-maker in Edinburgh and answered to the name of Miss <hi rend="italic">Broddie</hi>.  She used to come and sew with my nurse, sitting with her legs crossed in a masculine manner; and swinging her foot emphatically, she used to pour forth a perfectly unbroken stream of gossip.  I didn’t hear it, I was immersed in far more important business with a box of bricks, but the recollection of that thin, perpetual, shrill sound of a voice has echoed in my ears sinsyne.  I am bound to say she was younger than Tibbie, but there is no mistaking that and the indescribable and eminently Scottish expression.</p>
                     <p>I have been very much prevented of late, having carried out thoroughly to my own satisfaction two considerable illnesses, had a birthday, and visited Honolulu, where politics are (if possible) a shade more exasperating than they are with us.  I am told that it was just when I was on the point of leaving that I received your superlative epistle about the cricket eleven.  In that case it is impossible I should have answered it, which is inconsistent with my own recollection of the fact.  What I remember is, that I sat down under your immediate inspiration and wrote an answer in every way worthy.  If I didn’t, as it seems proved that I couldn’t, it will never be done now.  However, I did the next best thing, I equipped my cousin Graham Balfour with a letter of introduction, and from him, if you know how—for he is rather of the Scottish character—you may elicit all the information you can possibly wish to have as to us and ours.  Do not be bluffed off by the somewhat stern and monumental first impression that he may make upon you.  He is one of the best fellows in the world, and the same sort of fool that we are, only better-looking, with all the faults of Vailimans and some of his own—I say nothing about virtues.</p>
                     <p>I have lately been returning to my wallowing in the mire.  When I was a child, and indeed until I was nearly a man, I consistently read Covenanting books.  Now that I am a grey-beard—or would be, if I could raise the beard—I have returned, and for weeks back have read little else but Wodrow, Walker, Shields, etc.  Of course this is with an idea of a novel, but in the course of it I made a very curious discovery.  I have been accustomed to hear refined and intelligent critics—those who know so much better what we are than we do ourselves,—trace down my literary descent from all sorts of people, including Addison, of whom I could never read a word.  Well, laigh i’ your lug, sir—the clue was found.  My style is from the Covenanting writers.  Take a particular case—the fondness for rhymes.  I don’t know of any English prose-writer who rhymes except by accident, and then a stone had better be tied around his neck and himself cast into the sea.  But my Covenanting buckies rhyme all the time—a beautiful example of the unconscious rhyme above referred to.</p>
                     <p>Do you know, and have you really tasted, these delightful works?  If not, it should be remedied; there is enough of the Auld Licht in you to be ravished.</p>
                     <p>I suppose you know that success has so far attended my banners—my political banners I mean, and not my literary.  In conjunction with the Three Great Powers I have succeeded in getting rid of My President and My Chief-Justice.  They’ve gone home, the one to Germany, the other to Souwegia.  I hear little echoes of footfalls of their departing footsteps through the medium of the newspapers. . . .</p>
                     <p>Whereupon I make you my salute with the firm remark that it is time to be done with trifling and give us a great book, and my ladies fall into line with me to pay you a most respectful courtesy, and we all join in the cry, ‘Come to Vailima!’</p>
                     <p>My dear sir, your soul’s health is in it—you will never do the great book, you will never cease to work in L., etc., till you come to Vailima.</p>

                     <p>DEAR MR. LE GALLIENNE,—I have received some time ago, through our friend Miss Taylor, a book of yours.  But that was by no means my first introduction to your name.  The same book had stood already on my shelves; I had read articles of yours in the <hi rend="italic">Academy</hi>; and by a piece of constructive criticism (which I trust was sound) had arrived at the conclusion that you were ‘Log-roller.’  Since then I have seen your beautiful verses to your wife.  You are to conceive me, then, as only too ready to make the acquaintance of a man who loved good literature and could make it.  I had to thank you, besides, for a triumphant exposure of a paradox of my own: the literary-prostitute disappeared from view at a phrase of yours—‘The essence is not in the pleasure but the sale.’  True: you are right, I was wrong; the author is not the whore, but the libertine; and yet I shall let the passage stand.  It is an error, but it illustrated the truth for which I was contending, that literature—painting—all art, are no other than pleasures, which we turn into trades.</p>
                     <p>And more than all this, I had, and I have to thank you for the intimate loyalty you have shown to myself; for the eager welcome you give to what is good—for the courtly tenderness with which you touch on my defects.  I begin to grow old; I have given my top note, I fancy;—and I have written too many books.  The world begins to be weary of the old booth; and if not weary, familiar with the familiarity that breeds contempt.  I do not know that I am sensitive to criticism, if it be hostile; I am sensitive indeed, when it is friendly; and when I read such criticism as yours, I am emboldened to go on and praise God.</p>
                     <p>You are still young, and you may live to do much.  The little, artificial popularity of style in England tends, I think, to die out; the British pig returns to his true love, the love of the styleless, of the shapeless, of the slapdash and the disorderly.  There is trouble coming, I think; and you may have to hold the fort for us in evil days.</p>
                     <p>Lastly, let me apologise for the crucifixion that I am inflicting on you (<hi rend="italic">bien à contre-cœur</hi>) by my bad writing.  I was once the best of writers; landladies, puzzled as to my ‘trade,’ used to have their honest bosoms set at rest by a sight of a page of manuscript.—‘Ah,’ they would say, ‘no wonder they pay you for that’;—and when I sent it in to the printers, it was given to the boys!  I was about thirty-nine, I think, when I had a turn of scrivener’s palsy; my hand got worse; and for the first time, I received clean proofs.  But it has gone beyond that now, I know I am like my old friend James Payn, a terror to correspondents; and you would not believe the care with which this has been written.—Believe me to be, very sincerely yours,</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR CHARLES,—I am delighted with your idea, and first, I will here give an amended plan and afterwards give you a note of some of the difficulties.</p>
                     <p>[Plan of the Edinburgh edition—14 vols.]</p>
                     <p>. . . It may be a question whether my <hi rend="italic">Times</hi> letters might not be appended to the ‘Footnote’ with a note of the dates of discharge of Cedercrantz and Pilsach.</p>
                     <p>I am particularly pleased with this idea of yours, because I am come to a dead stop.  I never can remember how bad I have been before, but at any rate I am bad enough just now, I mean as to literature; in health I am well and strong.  I take it I shall be six months before I’m heard of again, and this time I could put in to some advantage in revising the text and (if it were thought desirable) writing prefaces.  I do not know how many of them might be thought desirable.  I have written a paper on <hi rend="italic">Treasure Island</hi>, which is to appear shortly.  <hi rend="italic">Master of Ballantrae</hi>—I have one drafted.  <hi rend="italic">The Wrecker</hi> is quite sufficiently done already with the last chapter, but I suppose an historic introduction to <hi rend="italic">David Balfour</hi> is quite unavoidable.  <hi rend="italic">Prince Otto</hi> I don’t think I could say anything about, and <hi rend="italic">Black Arrow</hi> don’t want to.  But it is probable I could say something to the volume of <hi rend="italic">Travels</hi>.  In the verse business I can do just what I like better than anything else, and extend <hi rend="italic">Underwoods</hi> with a lot of unpublished stuff.  <hi rend="italic">Apropos</hi>, if I were to get printed off a very few poems which are somewhat too intimate for the public, could you get them run up in some luxuous manner, so that fools might be induced to buy them in just a sufficient quantity to pay expenses and the thing remain still in a manner private?  We could supply photographs of the illustrations—and the poems are of Vailima and the family—I should much like to get this done as a surprise for Fanny.</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR BAILDON,—Last mail brought your book and its Dedication.  ‘Frederick Street and the gardens, and the short-lived Jack o’ Lantern,’ are again with me—and the note of the east wind, and Froebel’s voice, and the smell of soup in Thomson’s stair.  Truly, you had no need to put yourself under the protection of any other saint, were that saint our Tamate himself!  Yourself were enough, and yourself coming with so rich a sheaf.</p>
                     <p>For what is this that you say about the Muses?  They have certainly never better inspired you than in ‘Jael and Sisera,’ and ‘Herodias and John the Baptist,’ good stout poems, fiery and sound.  ‘’Tis but a mask and behind it chuckles the God of the Garden,’ I shall never forget.  By the by, an error of the press, page 49, line 4, ‘No infant’s lesson are the ways of God.’  <hi rend="italic">The</hi> is dropped.</p>
                     <p>And this reminds me you have a bad habit which is to be comminated in my theory of letters.  Same page, two lines lower: ‘But the vulture’s track’ is surely as fine to the ear as ‘But vulture’s track,’ and this latter version has a dreadful baldness.  The reader goes on with a sense of impoverishment, of unnecessary sacrifice; he has been robbed by footpads, and goes scouting for his lost article!  Again, in the second Epode, these fine verses would surely sound much finer if they began, ‘As a hardy climber who has set his heart,’ than with the jejune ‘As hardy climber.’  I do not know why you permit yourself this license with grammar; you show, in so many pages, that you are superior to the paltry sense of rhythm which usually dictates it—as though some poetaster had been suffered to correct the poet’s text.  By the way, I confess to a heartfelt weakness for <hi rend="italic">Auriculas</hi>.—Believe me the very grateful and characteristic pick-thank, but still sincere and affectionate,</p>
                     <p>Robert Louis Stevenson.</p>

                     <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">Vailima</hi>, <hi rend="italic">January</hi> 15th, 1894.</p>
                     <p>MY DEAR LOW,—. . . Pray you, stoop your proud head, and sell yourself to some Jew magazine, and make the visit out.  I assure you, this is the spot for a sculptor or painter.  This, and no other—I don’t say to stay there, but to come once and get the living colour into them.  I am used to it; I do not notice it; rather prefer my grey, freezing recollections of Scotland; but there it is, and every morning is a thing to give thanks for, and every night another—bar when it rains, of course.</p>
                     <p>About <hi rend="italic">The Wrecker</hi>—rather late days, and I still suspect I had somehow offended you; however, all’s well that ends well, and I am glad I am forgiven—did you not fail to appreciate the attitude of Dodd?  He was a fizzle and a stick, he knew it, he knew nothing else, and there is an undercurrent of bitterness in him.  And then the problem that Pinkerton laid down: why the artist can <hi rend="italic">do nothing else</hi>? is one that continually exercises myself.  He cannot: granted.  But Scott could.  And Montaigne.  And Julius Cæsar.  And many more.  And why can’t R. L. S.?  Does it not amaze you?  It does me.  I think of the Renaissance fellows, and their all-round human sufficiency, and compare it with the ineffable smallness of the field in which we labour and in which we do so little.  I think <hi rend="italic">David Balfour</hi> a nice little book, and very artistic, and just the thing to occupy the leisure of a busy man; but for the top flower of a man’s life it seems to me inadequate.  Small is the word; it is a small age, and I am of it.  I could have wished to be otherwise busy in this world.  I ought to have been able to build lighthouses and write <hi rend="italic">David Balfours</hi> too.  <hi rend="italic">Hinc illae lacrymae</hi>.  I take my own case as most handy, but it is as illustrative of my quarrel with the age.  We take all these pains, and we don’t do as well as Michael Angelo or Leonardo, or even Fielding, who was an active magistrate, or Richardson, who was a busy bookseller.  <hi rend="italic">J’ai honte pour nous</hi>; my ears burn.</p>
                     <p>I am amazed at the effect which this Chicago exhibition has produced upon you and others.  It set Mrs. Fairchild literally mad—to judge by her letters.  And I wish I had seen anything so influential.  I suppose there was an aura, a halo, some sort of effulgency about the place; for here I find you louder than the rest.  Well, it may be there is a time coming; and I wonder, when it comes, whether it will be a time of little, exclusive, one-eyed rascals like you and me, or parties of the old stamp who can paint and fight, and write and keep books of double entry, and sculp, and scalp.  It might be.  You have a lot of stuff in the kettle, and a great deal of it Celtic.  I have changed my mind progressively about England, practically the whole of Scotland is Celtic, and the western half of England, and all Ireland, and the Celtic blood makes a rare blend for art.  If it is stiffened up with Latin blood, you get the French.  We were less lucky: we had only Scandinavians, themselves decidedly artistic, and the Low-German lot.  However, that is a good starting-point, and with all the other elements in your crucible, it may come to something great very easily.  I wish you would hurry up and let me see it.  Here is a long while I have been waiting for something <hi rend="italic">good</hi> in art; and what have I seen?  Zola’s <hi rend="italic">Débâcle</hi> and a few of Kipling’s tales.  Are you a reader of Barbey d’Aurevilly?  He is a never-failing source of pleasure to me, for my sins, I suppose.  What a work is the <hi rend="italic">Rideau Cramoisi</hi>! and <hi rend="italic">L’Ensorcelée</hi>! and <hi rend="italic">Le Chevalier Des Touches</hi>!</p>
                     <p>This is degenerating into mere twaddle.  So please remember us all most kindly to Mrs. Low, and believe me ever yours,</p>
                     <p>Robert Louis Stevenson.</p>
                     <p>
                        <hi rend="italic">P.S.</hi>—Were all your privateers voiceless in the war of 1812?  Did <hi rend="italic">no one</hi> of them write memoirs?  I shall have to do my privateer from chic, if you can’t help me. <ref target="#6855990405419608431_637-h-3.htm.xhtml#footnote320">[320]</ref>  My application to Scribner has been quite in vain.  See if you can get hold of some historic sharp in the club, and tap him; they must some of them have written memoirs or notes of some sort; perhaps still unprinted; if that be so, get them copied for me.</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR BAILDON,—‘Call not blessed.’—Yes, if I could die just now, or say in half a year, I should have had a splendid time of it on the whole.  But it gets a little stale, and my work will begin to senesce; and parties to shy bricks at me; and now it begins to look as if I should survive to see myself impotent and forgotten.  It’s a pity suicide is not thought the ticket in the best circles.</p>
                     <p>But your letter goes on to congratulate me on having done the one thing I am a little sorry for; a little—not much—for my father himself lived to think that I had been wiser than he.  But the cream of the jest is that I have lived to change my mind; and think that he was wiser than I.  Had I been an engineer, and literature my amusement, it would have been better perhaps.  I pulled it off, of course, I won the wager, and it is pleasant while it lasts; but how long will it last?  I don’t know, say the Bells of Old Bow.</p>
                     <p>All of which goes to show that nobody is quite sane in judging himself.  Truly, had I given way and gone in for engineering, I should be dead by now.  Well, the gods know best.</p>

                     <p>In this world, which (as you justly say) is so full of sorrow and suffering, it will always please me to remember that my name is connected with some efforts after alleviation, nor less so with purposes of innocent recreation which, after all, are the only certain means at our disposal for bettering human life.</p>
                     <p>With kind regards, to yourself, to Mr. L. C. Congdon, to E. M. G. Bates, and to Mr. Edward Hugh Higlee Bates, and the heartiest wishes for the future success of the chapter, believe me, yours cordially,</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR ARCHER,—Many thanks for your <hi rend="italic">Theatrical World</hi>.  Do you know, it strikes me as being really very good?  I have not yet read much of it, but so far as I have looked, there is not a dull and not an empty page in it.  Hazlitt, whom you must often have thought of, would have been pleased.  Come to think of it, I shall put this book upon the Hazlitt shelf.  You have acquired a manner that I can only call august; otherwise, I should have to call it such amazing impudence.  The <hi rend="italic">Bauble Shop</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Becket</hi> are examples of what I mean.  But it ‘sets you weel.’</p>
                     <p>Marjorie Fleming I have known, as you surmise, for long.  She was possibly—no, I take back possibly—she was one of the greatest works of God.  Your note about the resemblance of her verses to mine gave me great joy, though it only proved me a plagiarist.  By the by, was it not over <hi rend="italic">The Child’s Garden of Verses</hi> that we first scraped acquaintance?  I am sorry indeed to hear that my esteemed correspondent Tomarcher has such poor taste in literature. <ref target="#6855990405419608431_637-h-3.htm.xhtml#footnote323">[323]</ref>  I fear he cannot have inherited this trait from his dear papa.  Indeed, I may say I know it, for I remember the energy of papa’s disapproval when the work passed through his hands on its way to a second birth, which none regrets more than myself.  It is an odd fact, or perhaps a very natural one; I find few greater pleasures than reading my own works, but I never, O I never read <hi rend="italic">The Black Arrow</hi>.  In that country Tomarcher reigns supreme.  Well, and after all, if Tomarcher likes it, it has not been written in vain.</p>
                     <p>We have just now a curious breath from Europe.  A young fellow just beginning letters, and no fool, turned up here with a letter of introduction in the well-known blue ink and decorative hieroglyphs of George Meredith.  His name may be known to you.  It is Sidney Lysaght.  He is staying with us but a day or two, and it is strange to me and not unpleasant to hear all the names, old and new, come up again.  But oddly the new are so much more in number.  If I revisited the glimpses of the moon on your side of the ocean, I should know comparatively few of them.</p>
                     <p>My amanuensis deserts me—I should have said you, for yours is the loss, my script having lost all bond with humanity.  One touch of nature makes the whole world kin: that nobody can read my hand.  It is a humiliating circumstance that thus evens us with printers!</p>
                     <p>You must sometimes think it strange—or perhaps it is only I that should so think it—to be following the old round, in the gas lamps and the crowded theatres, when I am away here in the tropical forest and the vast silences!</p>
                     <p>My dear Archer, my wife joins me in the best wishes to yourself and Mrs. Archer, not forgetting Tom; and I am yours very cordially,</p>

                     <p>DEAR SIR,—Long since when I was a boy I remember the emotions with which I repeated Swinburne’s poems and ballads.  Some ten years ago, a similar spell was cast upon me by Meredith’s <hi rend="italic">Love in the Valley</hi>; the stanzas beginning ‘When her mother tends her’ haunted me and made me drunk like wine; and I remember waking with them all the echoes of the hills about Hyères.  It may interest you to hear that I have a third time fallen in slavery: this is to your poem called the <hi rend="italic">Lake Isle of Innisfrae</hi>.  It is so quaint and airy, simple, artful, and eloquent to the heart—but I seek words in vain.  Enough that ‘always night and day I hear lake water lapping with low sounds on the shore,’ and am, yours gratefully,</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR MEREDITH,—Many good things have the gods sent to me of late.  First of all there was a letter from you by the kind hand of Mariette, if she is not too great a lady to be remembered in such a style; and then there came one Lysaght with a charming note of introduction in the well-known hand itself.  We had but a few days of him, and liked him well.  There was a sort of geniality and inward fire about him at which I warmed my hands.  It is long since I have seen a young man who has left in me such a favourable impression; and I find myself telling myself, ‘O, I must tell this to Lysaght,’ or, ‘This will interest him,’ in a manner very unusual after so brief an acquaintance.  The whole of my family shared in this favourable impression, and my halls have re-echoed ever since, I am sure he will be amused to know, with <hi rend="italic">Widdicombe Fair</hi>.</p>
                     <p>He will have told you doubtless more of my news than I could tell you myself; he has your European perspective, a thing long lost to me.  I heard with a great deal of interest the news of Box Hill.  And so I understand it is to be enclosed!  Allow me to remark, that seems a far more barbaric trait of manners than the most barbarous of ours.  We content ourselves with cutting off an occasional head.</p>
                     <p>I hear we may soon expect the <hi rend="italic">Amazing Marriage</hi>.  You know how long, and with how much curiosity, I have looked forward to the book.  Now, in so far as you have adhered to your intention, Gower Woodsere will be a family portrait, age twenty-five, of the highly respectable and slightly influential and fairly aged <hi rend="italic">Tusitala</hi>.  You have not known that gentleman; console yourself, he is not worth knowing.  At the same time, my dear Meredith, he is very sincerely yours—for what he is worth, for the memories of old times, and in the expectation of many pleasures still to come.  I suppose we shall never see each other again; flitting youths of the Lysaght species may occasionally cover these unconscionable leagues and bear greetings to and fro.  But we ourselves must be content to converse on an occasional sheet of notepaper, and I shall never see whether you have grown older, and you shall never deplore that Gower Woodsere should have declined into the pantaloon <hi rend="italic">Tusitala</hi>.  It is perhaps better so.  Let us continue to see each other as we were, and accept, my dear Meredith, my love and respect.</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR CHARLES,—<hi rend="italic">St. Ives</hi> is now well on its way into the second volume.  There remains no mortal doubt that it will reach the three volume standard.</p>
                     <p>I am very anxious that you should send me—</p>
                     <p>1<hi rend="italic">st</hi>.  <hi rend="italic">Tom and Jerry</hi>, a cheap edition.</p>
                     <p>2nd.  The book by Ashton—the <hi rend="italic">Dawn of the Century</hi>, I think it was called—which Colvin sent me, and which has miscarried, and</p>
                     <p>3rd.  If it is possible, a file of the <hi rend="italic">Edinburgh Courant</hi> for the years 1811, 1812, 1813, or 1814.  I should not care for a whole year.  If it were possible to find me three months, winter months by preference, it would do my business not only for <hi rend="italic">St. Ives</hi>, but for the <hi rend="italic">Justice-Clerk</hi> as well.  Suppose this to be impossible, perhaps I could get the loan of it from somebody; or perhaps it would be possible to have some one read a file for me and make notes.  This would be extremely bad, as unhappily one man’s food is another man’s poison, and the reader would probably leave out everything I should choose.  But if you are reduced to that, you might mention to the man who is to read for me that balloon ascensions are in the order of the day.</p>
                     <p>4th.  It might be as well to get a book on balloon ascension, particularly in the early part of the century.</p>
                     <p>. . . . .</p>
                     <p>III.  At last this book has come from Scribner, and, alas!  I have the first six or seven chapters of <hi rend="italic">St. Ives</hi> to recast entirely.  Who could foresee that they clothed the French prisoners in yellow?  But that one fatal fact—and also that they shaved them twice a week—damns the whole beginning.  If it had been sent in time, it would have saved me a deal of trouble. . . .</p>
                     <p>I have had a long letter from Dr. Scott Dalgleish, 25 Mayfield Terrace, asking me to put my name down to the Ballantyne Memorial Committee.  I have sent him a pretty sharp answer in favour of cutting down the memorial and giving more to the widow and children.  If there is to be any foolery in the way of statues or other trash, please send them a guinea; but if they are going to take my advice and put up a simple tablet with a few heartfelt words, and really devote the bulk of the subscriptions to the wife and family, I will go to the length of twenty pounds, if you will allow me (and if the case of the family be at all urgent), and at least I direct you to send ten pounds.  I suppose you had better see Scott Dalgleish himself on the matter.  I take the opportunity here to warn you that my head is simply spinning with a multitude of affairs, and I shall probably forget a half of my business at last.</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR FRIEND,—I have at last got some photographs, and hasten to send you, as you asked, a portrait of Tusitala.  He is a strange person; not so lean, say experts, but infinitely battered; mighty active again on the whole; going up and down our break-neck road at all hours of the day and night on horseback; holding meetings with all manner of chiefs; quite a political personage—God save the mark!—in a small way, but at heart very conscious of the inevitable flat failure that awaits every one.  I shall never do a better book than <hi rend="italic">Catriona</hi>, that is my high-water mark, and the trouble of production increases on me at a great rate—and mighty anxious about how I am to leave my family: an elderly man, with elderly preoccupations, whom I should be ashamed to show you for your old friend; but not a hope of my dying soon and cleanly, and ‘winning off the stage.’  Rather I am daily better in physical health.  I shall have to see this business out, after all; and I think, in that case, they should have—they might have—spared me all my ill-health this decade past, if it were not to unbar the doors.  I have no taste for old age, and my nose is to be rubbed in it in spite of my face.  I was meant to die young, and the gods do not love me.</p>
                     <p>This is very like an epitaph, bar the handwriting, which is anything but monumental, and I dare say I had better stop.  Fanny is down at her own cottage planting or deplanting or replanting, I know not which, and she will not be home till dinner, by which time the mail will be all closed, else she would join me in all good messages and remembrances of love.  I hope you will congratulate Burne Jones from me on his baronetcy.  I cannot make out to be anything but raspingly, harrowingly sad; so I will close, and not affect levity which I cannot feel.  Do not altogether forget me; keep a corner of your memory for the exile</p>
                     <p>Louis.</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR CHARLES,—My dear fellow, I wish to assure you of the greatness of the pleasure that this Edinburgh Edition gives me.  I suppose it was your idea to give it that name.  No other would have affected me in the same manner.  Do you remember, how many years ago—I would be afraid to hazard a guess—one night when I communicated to you certain intimations of early death and aspirations after fame?  I was particularly maudlin; and my remorse the next morning on a review of my folly has written the matter very deeply in my mind; from yours it may easily have fled.  If any one at that moment could have shown me the Edinburgh Edition, I suppose I should have died.  It is with gratitude and wonder that I consider ‘the way in which I have been led.’  Could a more preposterous idea have occurred to us in those days when we used to search our pockets for coppers, too often in vain, and combine forces to produce the threepence necessary for two glasses of beer, or wander down the Lothian Road without any, than that I should be strong and well at the age of forty-three in the island of Upolu, and that you should be at home bringing out the Edinburgh Edition?  If it had been possible, I should almost have preferred the Lothian Road Edition, say, with a picture of the old Dutch smuggler on the covers.  I have now something heavy on my mind.  I had always a great sense of kinship with poor Robert Fergusson—so clever a boy, so wild, of such a mixed strain, so unfortunate, born in the same town with me, and, as I always felt, rather by express intimation than from evidence, so like myself.  Now the injustice with which the one Robert is rewarded and the other left out in the cold sits heavy on me, and I wish you could think of some way in which I could do honour to my unfortunate namesake.  Do you think it would look like affectation to dedicate the whole edition to his memory?  I think it would.  The sentiment which would dictate it to me is too abstruse; and besides, I think my wife is the proper person to receive the dedication of my life’s work.  At the same time, it is very odd—it really looks like the transmigration of souls—I feel that I must do something for Fergusson; Burns has been before me with the gravestone.  It occurs to me you might take a walk down the Canongate and see in what condition the stone is.  If it be at all uncared for, we might repair it, and perhaps add a few words of inscription.</p>
                     <p>I must tell you, what I just remembered in a flash as I was walking about dictating this letter—there was in the original plan of the <hi rend="italic">Master of Ballantrae</hi> a sort of introduction describing my arrival in Edinburgh on a visit to yourself and your placing in my hands the papers of the story.  I actually wrote it, and then condemned the idea—as being a little too like Scott, I suppose.  Now I must really find the MS. and try to finish it for the E. E.  It will give you, what I should so much like you to have, another corner of your own in that lofty monument.</p>
                     <p>Suppose we do what I have proposed about Fergusson’s monument, I wonder if an inscription like this would look arrogant—</p>
                     <p>This stone originally erected<lb/>by Robert Burns has been<lb/>repaired at the<lb/>charges of Robert Louis Stevenson,<lb/>and is by him re-dedicated to<lb/>the memory of Robert Fergusson,<lb/>as the gift of one Edinburgh<lb/>lad to another.</p>
                     <p>In spacing this inscription I would detach the names of Fergusson and Burns, but leave mine in the text.</p>
                     <p>Or would that look like sham modesty, and is it better to bring out the three Roberts?</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR BOB,—I must make out a letter this mail or perish in the attempt.  All the same, I am deeply stupid, in bed with a cold, deprived of my amanuensis, and conscious of the wish but not the furnished will.  You may be interested to hear how the family inquiries go.  It is now quite certain that we are a second-rate lot, and came out of Cunningham or Clydesdale, therefore <hi rend="italic">British</hi> folk; so that you are Cymry on both sides, and I Cymry and Pict.  We may have fought with King Arthur and known Merlin.  The first of the family, Stevenson of Stevenson, was quite a great party, and dates back to the wars of Edward First.  The last male heir of Stevenson of Stevenson died 1670, £220, 10s. to the bad, from drink.  About the same time the Stevensons, who were mostly in Cunningham before, crop up suddenly in the parish of Neilston, over the border in Renfrewshire.  Of course, they may have been there before, but there is no word of them in that parish till 1675 in any extracts I have.  Our first traceable ancestor was a tenant farmer of Muir of Cauldwells—James in Nether-Carsewell.  Presently two families of maltmen are found in Glasgow, both, by re-duplicated proofs, related to James (the son of James) in Nether Carsewell.  We descend by his second marriage from Robert; one of these died 1733.  It is not very romantic up to now, but has interested me surprisingly to fish out, always hoping for more—and occasionally getting at least a little clearness and confirmation.  But the earliest date, 1655, apparently the marriage of James in Nether Carsewell, cannot as yet be pushed back.  From which of any number of dozen little families in Cunningham we should derive, God knows!  Of course, it doesn’t matter a hundred years hence, an argument fatal to all human enterprise, industry, or pleasure.  And to me it will be a deadly disappointment if I cannot roll this stone away!  One generation further might be nothing, but it is my present object of desire, and we are so near it!  There is a man in the same parish called Constantine; if I could only trace to him, I could take you far afield by that one talisman of the strange Christian name of Constantine.  But no such luck!  And I kind of fear we shall stick at James.</p>
                     <p>So much, though all inchoate, I trouble you with, knowing that you, at least, must take an interest in it.  So much is certain of that strange Celtic descent, that the past has an interest for it apparently gratuitous, but fiercely strong.  I wish to trace my ancestors a thousand years, if I trace them by gallowses.  It is not love, not pride, not admiration; it is an expansion of the identity, intimately pleasing, and wholly uncritical; I can expend myself in the person of an inglorious ancestor with perfect comfort; or a disgraced, if I could find one.  I suppose, perhaps, it is more to me who am childless, and refrain with a certain shock from looking forwards.  But, I am sure, in the solid grounds of race, that you have it also in some degree. <ref target="#6855990405419608431_637-h-3.htm.xhtml#footnote332">[332]</ref>

                     <p>I.  James, a tenant of the Muirs, in Nether-Carsewell, Neilston, married (1665?) Jean Keir.</p>
                     <p>II.  Robert (Maltman in Glasgow), died 1733, married 1st; married second, Elizabeth Cumming.</p>
                     <p>[Of Robert and 1st marriage: William (Maltman in Glasgow), of him: Robert, Marion and Elizabeth]</p>
                     <p>III. Robert [of Robert and Elizabeth Cumming] (Maltman in Glasgow), married Margaret Fulton (had a large family).</p>
                     <p>IV. Alan, West India merchant, married Jean Lillie.</p>
                     <p>V.  Robert, married Jean Smith.</p>
                     <p>VI.  Alan.—Margaret Jones.</p>
                     <p>VII.  R. A. M. S.</p>
                     <p>Note.—Between 1730–1766 flourished in Glasgow Alan the Coppersmith, who acts as a kind of a pin to the whole Stevenson system there.  He was caution to Robert the Second’s will, and to William’s will, and to the will of a John, another maltman.</p>
                     <p>Enough genealogy.  I do not know if you will be able to read my hand.  Unhappily, Belle, who is my amanuensis, is out of the way on other affairs, and I have to make the unwelcome effort.  (O this is beautiful, I am quite pleased with myself.)  Graham has just arrived last night (my mother is coming by the other steamer in three days), and has told me of your meeting, and he said you looked a little older than I did; so that I suppose we keep step fairly on the downward side of the hill.  He thought you looked harassed, and I could imagine that too.  I sometimes feel harassed.  I have a great family here about me, a great anxiety.  The loss (to use my grandfather’s expression), the ‘loss’ of our family is that we are disbelievers in the morrow—perhaps I should say, rather, in next year.  The future is <hi rend="italic">always</hi> black to us; it was to Robert Stevenson; to Thomas; I suspect to Alan; to R. A. M. S. it was so almost to his ruin in youth; to R. L. S., who had a hard hopeful strain in him from his mother, it was not so much so once, but becomes daily more so.  Daily so much more so, that I have a painful difficulty in believing I can ever finish another book, or that the public will ever read it.</p>
                     <p>I have so huge a desire to know exactly what you are doing, that I suppose I should tell you what I am doing by way of an example.  I have a room now, a part of the twelve-foot verandah sparred in, at the most inaccessible end of the house.  Daily I see the sunrise out of my bed, which I still value as a tonic, a perpetual tuning fork, a look of God’s face once in the day.  At six my breakfast comes up to me here, and I work till eleven.  If I am quite well, I sometimes go out and bathe in the river before lunch, twelve.  In the afternoon I generally work again, now alone drafting, now with Belle dictating.  Dinner is at six, and I am often in bed by eight.  This is supposing me to stay at home.  But I must often be away, sometimes all day long, sometimes till twelve, one, or two at night, when you might see me coming home to the sleeping house, sometimes in a trackless darkness, sometimes with a glorious tropic moon, everything drenched with dew—unsaddling and creeping to bed; and you would no longer be surprised that I live out in this country, and not in Bournemouth—in bed.</p>
                     <p>My great recent interruptions have (as you know) come from politics; not much in my line, you will say.  But it is impossible to live here and not feel very sorely the consequences of the horrid white mismanagement.  I tried standing by and looking on, and it became too much for me.  They are such illogical fools; a logical fool in an office, with a lot of red tape, is conceivable.  Furthermore, he is as much as we have any reason to expect of officials—a thoroughly common-place, unintellectual lot.  But these people are wholly on wires; laying their ears down, skimming away, pausing as though shot, and presto! full spread on the other tack.  I observe in the official class mostly an insane jealousy of the smallest kind, as compared to which the artist’s is of a grave, modest character—the actor’s, even; a desire to extend his little authority, and to relish it like a glass of wine, that is <hi rend="italic">impayable</hi>.  Sometimes, when I see one of these little kings strutting over one of his victories—wholly illegal, perhaps, and certain to be reversed to his shame if his superiors ever heard of it—I could weep.  The strange thing is that they <hi rend="italic">have nothing else</hi>.  I auscultate them in vain; no real sense of duty, no real comprehension, no real attempt to comprehend, no wish for information—you cannot offend one of them more bitterly than by offering information, though it is certain that you have <hi rend="italic">more</hi>, and obvious that you have <hi rend="italic">other</hi>, information than they have; and talking of policy, they could not play a better stroke than by listening to you, and it need by no means influence their action.  <hi rend="italic">Tenez</hi>, you know what a French post office or railway official is?  That is the diplomatic card to the life.  Dickens is not in it; caricature fails.</p>
                     <p>All this keeps me from my work, and gives me the unpleasant side of the world.  When your letters are disbelieved it makes you angry, and that is rot; and I wish I could keep out of it with all my soul.  But I have just got into it again, and farewell peace!</p>
                     <p>My work goes along but slowly.  I have got to a crossing place, I suppose; the present book, <hi rend="italic">Saint Ives</hi>, is nothing; it is in no style in particular, a tissue of adventures, the central character not very well done, no philosophic pith under the yarn; and, in short, if people will read it, that’s all I ask; and if they won’t, damn them!  I like doing it though; and if you ask me why!—after that I am on <hi rend="italic">Weir of Hermiston</hi> and <hi rend="italic">Heathercat</hi>, two Scotch stories, which will either be something different, or I shall have failed.  The first is generally designed, and is a private story of two or three characters in a very grim vein.  The second—alas! the thought—is an attempt at a real historical novel, to present a whole field of time; the race—our own race—the west land and Clydesdale blue bonnets, under the influence of their last trial, when they got to a pitch of organisation in madness that no other peasantry has ever made an offer at.  I was going to call it <hi rend="italic">The Killing Time</hi>, but this man Crockett has forestalled me in that.  Well, it’ll be a big smash if I fail in it; but a gallant attempt.  All my weary reading as a boy, which you remember well enough, will come to bear on it; and if my mind will keep up to the point it was in a while back, perhaps I can pull it through.</p>
                     <p>For two months past, Fanny, Belle, Austin (her child), and I have been alone; but yesterday, as I mentioned, Graham Balfour arrived, and on Wednesday my mother and Lloyd will make up the party to its full strength.  I wish you could drop in for a month or a week, or two hours.  That is my chief want.  On the whole, it is an unexpectedly pleasant corner I have dropped into for an end of it, which I could scarcely have foreseen from Wilson’s shop, or the Princes Street Gardens, or the Portobello Road.  Still, I would like to hear what my <hi rend="italic">alter ego</hi> thought of it; and I would sometimes like to have my old <hi rend="italic">maître ès arts</hi> express an opinion on what I do.  I put this very tamely, being on the whole a quiet elderly man; but it is a strong passion with me, though intermittent.  Now, try to follow my example and tell me something about yourself, Louisa, the Bab, and your work; and kindly send me some specimens of what you’re about.  I have only seen one thing by you, about Notre Dame in the <hi rend="italic">Westminster</hi> or <hi rend="italic">St. James’s</hi>, since I left England, now I suppose six years ago.</p>
                     <p>I have looked this trash over, and it is not at all the letter I wanted to write—not truck about officials, ancestors, and the like rancidness—but you have to let your pen go in its own broken-down gait, like an old butcher’s pony, stop when it pleases, and go on again as it will.—Ever, my dear Bob, your affectionate cousin,</p>
                     <p>R. L. Stevenson.</p>

                     <p>DEAR HENRY JAMES,—I am going to try and dictate to you a letter or a note, and begin the same without any spark of hope, my mind being entirely in abeyance.  This malady is very bitter on the literary man.  I have had it now coming on for a month, and it seems to get worse instead of better.  If it should prove to be softening of the brain, a melancholy interest will attach to the present document.  I heard a great deal about you from my mother and Graham Balfour; the latter declares that you could take a First in any Samoan subject.  If that be so, I should like to hear you on the theory of the constitution.  Also to consult you on the force of the particles <hi rend="italic">o lo ’o</hi> and <hi rend="italic">ua</hi>, which are the subject of a dispute among local pundits.  You might, if you ever answer this, give me your opinion on the origin of the Samoan race, just to complete the favour.</p>
                     <p>They both say that you are looking well, and I suppose I may conclude from that that you are feeling passably.  I wish I was.  Do not suppose from this that I am ill in body; it is the numskull that I complain of.  And when that is wrong, as you must be very keenly aware, you begin every day with a smarting disappointment, which is not good for the temper.  I am in one of the humours when a man wonders how any one can be such an ass as to embrace the profession of letters, and not get apprenticed to a barber or keep a baked-potato stall.  But I have no doubt in the course of a week, or perhaps to-morrow, things will look better.</p>
                     <p>We have at present in port the model warship of Great Britain.  She is called the <hi rend="italic">Curaçoa</hi>, and has the nicest set of officers and men conceivable.  They, the officers, are all very intimate with us, and the front verandah is known as the Curaçoa Club, and the road up to Vailima is known as the Curaçoa Track.  It was rather a surprise to me; many naval officers have I known, and somehow had not learned to think entirely well of them, and perhaps sometimes ask myself a little uneasily how that kind of men could do great actions? and behold! the answer comes to me, and I see a ship that I would guarantee to go anywhere it was possible for men to go, and accomplish anything it was permitted man to attempt.  I had a cruise on board of her not long ago to Manu’a, and was delighted.  The goodwill of all on board; the grim playfulness of — <ref target="#6855990405419608431_637-h-3.htm.xhtml#footnote337">[337]</ref> quarters, with the wounded falling down at the word; the ambulances hastening up and carrying them away; the Captain suddenly crying, ‘Fire in the ward-room!’ and the squad hastening forward with the hose; and, last and most curious spectacle of all, all the men in their dust-coloured fatigue clothes, at a note of the bugle, falling simultaneously flat on deck, and the ship proceeding with its prostrate crew—<hi rend="italic">quasi</hi> to ram an enemy; our dinner at night in a wild open anchorage, the ship rolling almost to her gunwales, and showing us alternately her bulwarks up in the sky, and then the wild broken cliffy palm-crested shores of the island with the surf thundering and leaping close aboard.  We had the ward-room mess on deck, lit by pink wax tapers, everybody, of course, in uniform but myself, and the first lieutenant (who is a rheumaticky body) wrapped in a boat cloak.  Gradually the sunset faded out, the island disappeared from the eye, though it remained menacingly present to the ear with the voice of the surf; and then the captain turned on the searchlight and gave us the coast, the beach, the trees, the native houses, and the cliffs by glimpses of daylight, a kind of deliberate lightning.  About which time, I suppose, we must have come as far as the dessert, and were probably drinking our first glass of port to Her Majesty.  We stayed two days at the island, and had, in addition, a very picturesque snapshot at the native life.  The three islands of Manu’a are independent, and are ruled over by a little slip of a half-caste girl about twenty, who sits all day in a pink gown, in a little white European house with about a quarter of an acre of roses in front of it, looking at the palm-trees on the village street, and listening to the surf.  This, so far as I could discover, was all she had to do.  ‘This is a very dull place,’ she said.  It appears she could go to no other village for fear of raising the jealousy of her own people in the capital.  And as for going about ‘tafatafaoing,’ as we say here, its cost was too enormous.  A strong able-bodied native must walk in front of her and blow the conch shell continuously from the moment she leaves one house until the moment she enters another.  Did you ever blow the conch shell?  I presume not; but the sweat literally hailed off that man, and I expected every moment to see him burst a blood-vessel.  We were entertained to kava in the guest-house with some very original features.  The young men who run for the <hi rend="italic">kava</hi> have a right to misconduct themselves <hi rend="italic">ad libitum</hi> on the way back; and though they were told to restrain themselves on the occasion of our visit, there was a strange hurly-burly at their return, when they came beating the trees and the posts of the houses, leaping, shouting, and yelling like Bacchants.</p>
                     <p>I tasted on that occasion what it is to be great.  My name was called next after the captain’s, and several chiefs (a thing quite new to me, and not at all Samoan practice) drank to me by name.</p>
                     <p>And now, if you are not sick of the <hi rend="italic">Curaçoa</hi> and Manu’a, I am, at least on paper.  And I decline any longer to give you examples of how not to write.</p>
                     <p>By the by, you sent me long ago a work by Anatole France, which I confess I did not <hi rend="italic">taste</hi>.  Since then I have made the acquaintance of the <hi rend="italic">Abbé Coignard</hi>, and have become a faithful adorer.  I don’t think a better book was ever written.</p>
                     <p>And I have no idea what I have said, and I have no idea what I ought to have said, and I am a total ass, but my heart is in the right place, and I am, my dear Henry James, yours,</p>

                     <p>DEAR MR. MARCEL SCHWOB,—Thank you for having remembered me in my exile.  I have read <hi rend="italic">Mimes</hi> twice as a whole; and now, as I write, I am reading it again as it were by accident, and a piece at a time, my eye catching a word and travelling obediently on through the whole number.  It is a graceful book, essentially graceful, with its haunting agreeable melancholy, its pleasing savour of antiquity.  At the same time, by its merits, it shows itself rather as the promise of something else to come than a thing final in itself.  You have yet to give us—and I am expecting it with impatience—something of a larger gait; something daylit, not twilit; something with the colours of life, not the flat tints of a temple illumination; something that shall be <hi rend="italic">said</hi> with all the clearnesses and the trivialities of speech, not <hi rend="italic">sung</hi> like a semi-articulate lullaby.  It will not please yourself as well, when you come to give it us, but it will please others better.  It will be more of a whole, more worldly, more nourished, more commonplace—and not so pretty, perhaps not even so beautiful.  No man knows better than I that, as we go on in life, we must part from prettiness and the graces.  We but attain qualities to lose them; life is a series of farewells, even in art; even our proficiencies are deciduous and evanescent.  So here with these exquisite pieces the XVIIth, XVIIIth, and IVth of the present collection.  You will perhaps never excel them; I should think the ‘Hermes,’ never.  Well, you will do something else, and of that I am in expectation.—Yours cordially,</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR ST. GAUDENS,—This is to tell you that the medallion has been at last triumphantly transported up the hill and placed over my smoking-room mantelpiece.  It is considered by everybody a first-rate but flattering portrait.  We have it in a very good light, which brings out the artistic merits of the god-like sculptor to great advantage.  As for my own opinion, I believe it to be a speaking likeness, and not flattered at all; possibly a little the reverse.  The verses (curse the rhyme) look remarkably well.</p>
                     <p>Please do not longer delay, but send me an account for the expense of the gilt letters.  I was sorry indeed that they proved beyond the means of a small farmer.—Yours very sincerely,</p>
                     <p>Robert Louis Stevenson.</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR ADELAIDE,—. . . So, at last, you are going into mission work? where I think your heart always was.  You will like it in a way, but remember it is dreary long.  Do you know the story of the American tramp who was offered meals and a day’s wage to chop with the back of an axe on a fallen trunk.  ‘Damned if I can go on chopping when I can’t see the chips fly!’  You will never see the chips fly in mission work, never; and be sure you know it beforehand.  The work is one long dull disappointment, varied by acute revulsions; and those who are by nature courageous and cheerful and have grown old in experience, learn to rub their hands over infinitesimal successes.  However, as I really believe there is some good done in the long run—<hi rend="italic">gutta cavat lapidem non vi</hi> in this business—it is a useful and honourable career in which no one should be ashamed to embark.  Always remember the fable of the sun, the storm, and the traveller’s cloak.  Forget wholly and for ever all small pruderies, and remember that <hi rend="italic">you cannot change ancestral feelings of right and wrong without what is practically soul-murder</hi>.  Barbarous as the customs may seem, always hear them with patience, always judge them with gentleness, always find in them some seed of good; see that you always develop them; remember that all you can do is to civilise the man in the line of his own civilisation, such as it is.  And never expect, never believe in, thaumaturgic conversions.  They may do very well for St. Paul; in the case of an Andaman islander they mean less than nothing.  In fact, what you have to do is to teach the parents in the interests of their great-grandchildren.</p>
                     <p>Now, my dear Adelaide, dismiss from your mind the least idea of fault upon your side; nothing is further from the fact.  I cannot forgive you, for I do not know your fault.  My own is plain enough, and the name of it is cold-hearted neglect; and you may busy yourself more usefully in trying to forgive me.  But ugly as my fault is, you must not suppose it to mean more than it does; it does not mean that we have at all forgotten you, that we have become at all indifferent to the thought of you.  See, in my life of Jenkin, a remark of his, very well expressed, on the friendships of men who do not write to each other.  I can honestly say that I have not changed to you in any way; though I have behaved thus ill, thus cruelly.  Evil is done by want of—well, principally by want of industry.  You can imagine what I would say (in a novel) of any one who had behaved as I have done.  <hi rend="italic">Deteriora sequor</hi>.  And you must somehow manage to forgive your old friend; and if you will be so very good, continue to give us news of you, and let us share the knowledge of your adventures, sure that it will be always followed with interest—even if it is answered with the silence of ingratitude.  For I am not a fool; I know my faults, I know they are ineluctable, I know they are growing on me.  I know I may offend again, and I warn you of it.  But the next time I offend, tell me so plainly and frankly like a lady, and don’t lacerate my heart and bludgeon my vanity with imaginary faults of your own and purely gratuitous penitence.  I might suspect you of irony!</p>
                     <p>We are all fairly well, though I have been off work and off—as you know very well—letter-writing.  Yet I have sometimes more than twenty letters, and sometimes more than thirty, going out each mail.  And Fanny has had a most distressing bronchitis for some time, which she is only now beginning to get over.  I have just been to see her; she is lying—though she had breakfast an hour ago, about seven—in her big cool, mosquito-proof room, ingloriously asleep.  As for me, you see that a doom has come upon me: I cannot make marks with a pen—witness ‘ingloriously’ above; and my amanuensis not appearing so early in the day, for she is then immersed in household affairs, and I can hear her ‘steering the boys’ up and down the verandahs—you must decipher this unhappy letter for yourself and, I fully admit, with everything against you.  A letter should be always well written; how much more a letter of apology!  Legibility is the politeness of men of letters, as punctuality of kings and beggars.  By the punctuality of my replies, and the beauty of my hand-writing, judge what a fine conscience I must have!</p>
                     <p>Now, my dear gamekeeper, I must really draw to a close.  For I have much else to write before the mail goes out three days hence.  Fanny being asleep, it would not be conscientious to invent a message from her, so you must just imagine her sentiments.  I find I have not the heart to speak of your recent loss.  You remember perhaps, when my father died, you told me those ugly images of sickness, decline, and impaired reason, which then haunted me day and night, would pass away and be succeeded by things more happily characteristic.  I have found it so.  He now haunts me, strangely enough, in two guises; as a man of fifty, lying on a hillside and carving mottoes on a stick, strong and well; and as a younger man, running down the sands into the sea near North Berwick, myself—<hi rend="italic">ætat</hi>. 11—somewhat horrified at finding him so beautiful when stripped!  I hand on your own advice to you in case you have forgotten it, as I know one is apt to do in seasons of bereavement.—Ever yours, with much love and sympathy,</p>
                     <p>Robert Louis Stevenson.</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR BARRIE,—This is the last effort of an ulcerated conscience.  I have been so long owing you a letter, I have heard so much of you, fresh from the press, from my mother and Graham Balfour, that I have to write a letter no later than to-day, or perish in my shame.  But the deuce of it is, my dear fellow, that you write such a very good letter that I am ashamed to exhibit myself before my junior (which you are, after all) in the light of the dreary idiot I feel.  Understand that there will be nothing funny in the following pages.  If I can manage to be rationally coherent, I shall be more than satisfied.</p>
                     <p>In the first place, I have had the extreme satisfaction to be shown that photograph of your mother.  It bears evident traces of the hand of an amateur.  How is it that amateurs invariably take better photographs than professionals?  I must qualify invariably.  My own negatives have always represented a province of chaos and old night in which you might dimly perceive fleecy spots of twilight, representing nothing; so that, if I am right in supposing the portrait of your mother to be yours, I must salute you as my superior.  Is that your mother’s breakfast?  Or is it only afternoon tea?  If the first, do let me recommend to Mrs. Barrie to add an egg to her ordinary.  Which, if you please, I will ask her to eat to the honour of her son, and I am sure she will live much longer for it, to enjoy his fresh successes.  I never in my life saw anything more deliciously characteristic.  I declare I can hear her speak.  I wonder my mother could resist the temptation of your proposed visit to Kirriemuir, which it was like your kindness to propose.  By the way, I was twice in Kirriemuir, I believe in the year ’71, when I was going on a visit to Glenogil.  It was Kirriemuir, was it not?  I have a distinct recollection of an inn at the end—I think the upper end—of an irregular open place or square, in which I always see your characters evolve.  But, indeed, I did not pay much attention; being all bent upon my visit to a shooting-box, where I should fish a real trout-stream, and I believe preserved.  I did, too, and it was a charming stream, clear as crystal, without a trace of peat—a strange thing in Scotland—and alive with trout; the name of it I cannot remember, it was something like the Queen’s River, and in some hazy way connected with memories of Mary Queen of Scots.  It formed an epoch in my life, being the end of all my trout-fishing.  I had always been accustomed to pause and very laboriously to kill every fish as I took it.  But in the Queen’s River I took so good a basket that I forgot these niceties; and when I sat down, in a hard rain shower, under a bank, to take my sandwiches and sherry, lo! and behold, there was the basketful of trouts still kicking in their agony.  I had a very unpleasant conversation with my conscience.  All that afternoon I persevered in fishing, brought home my basket in triumph, and sometime that night, ‘in the wee sma’ hours ayont the twal,’ I finally forswore the gentle craft of fishing.  I dare say your local knowledge may identify this historic river; I wish it could go farther and identify also that particular Free kirk in which I sat and groaned on Sunday.  While my hand is in I must tell you a story.  At that antique epoch you must not fall into the vulgar error that I was myself ancient.  I was, on the contrary, very young, very green, and (what you will appreciate, Mr. Barrie) very shy.  There came one day to lunch at the house two very formidable old ladies—or one very formidable, and the other what you please—answering to the honoured and historic name of the Miss C— A—’s of Balnamoon.  At table I was exceedingly funny, and entertained the company with tales of geese and bubbly-jocks.  I was great in the expression of my terror for these bipeds, and suddenly this horrid, severe, and eminently matronly old lady put up a pair of gold eye-glasses, looked at me awhile in silence, and pronounced in a clangorous voice her verdict.  ‘You give me very much the effect of a coward, Mr. Stevenson!’  I had very nearly left two vices behind me at Glenogil—fishing and jesting at table.  And of one thing you may be very sure, my lips were no more opened at that meal.</p>

                     </p>
                     <p>No, Barrie, ’tis in vain they try to alarm me with their bulletins.  No doubt, you’re ill, and unco ill, I believe; but I have been so often in the same case that I know pleurisy and pneumonia are in vain against Scotsmen who can write, (I once could.)  You cannot imagine probably how near me this common calamity brings you.  <hi rend="italic">Ce que j’ai toussé dans ma vie</hi>!  How often and how long have I been on the rack at night and learned to appreciate that noble passage in the Psalms when somebody or other is said to be more set on something than they ‘who dig for hid treasures—yea, than those who long for the morning’—for all the world, as you have been racked and you have longed.  Keep your heart up, and you’ll do.  Tell that to your mother, if you are still in any danger or suffering.  And by the way, if you are at all like me—and I tell myself you are very like me—be sure there is only one thing good for you, and that is the sea in hot climates.  Mount, sir, into ‘a little frigot’ of 5000 tons or so, and steer peremptorily for the tropics; and what if the ancient mariner, who guides your frigot, should startle the silence of the ocean with the cry of land ho!—say, when the day is dawning—and you should see the turquoise mountain tops of Upolu coming hand over fist above the horizon?  Mr. Barrie, sir, ’tis then there would be larks!  And though I cannot be certain that our climate would suit you (for it does not suit some), I am sure as death the voyage would do you good—would do you <hi rend="italic">Best</hi>—and if Samoa didn’t do, you needn’t stay beyond the month, and I should have had another pleasure in my life, which is a serious consideration for me.  I take this as the hand of the Lord preparing your way to Vailima—in the desert, certainly—in the desert of Cough and by the ghoul-haunted woodland of Fever—but whither that way points there can be no question—and there will be a meeting of the twa Hoasting Scots Makers in spite of fate, fortune, and the Devil.  <hi rend="italic">Absit omen</hi>!</p>
                     <p>My dear Barrie, I am a little in the dark about this new work of yours <ref target="#6855990405419608431_637-h-3.htm.xhtml#footnote347">[347]</ref>: what is to become of me afterwards?  You say carefully—methought anxiously—that I was no longer me when I grew up?  I cannot bear this suspense: what is it?  It’s no forgery?  And AM I HANGIT?  These are the elements of a very pretty lawsuit which you had better come to Samoa to compromise.  I am enjoying a great pleasure that I had long looked forward to, reading Orme’s <hi rend="italic">History of Indostan</hi>; I had been looking out for it everywhere; but at last, in four volumes, large quarto, beautiful type and page, and with a delectable set of maps and plans, and all the names of the places wrongly spelled—it came to Samoa, little Barrie.  I tell you frankly, you had better come soon.  I am sair failed a’ready; and what I may be if you continue to dally, I dread to conceive.  I may be speechless; already, or at least for a month or so, I’m little better than a teetoller—I beg pardon, a teetotaller.  It is not exactly physical, for I am in good health, working four or five hours a day in my plantation, and intending to ride a paper-chase next Sunday—ay, man, that’s a fact, and I havena had the hert to breathe it to my mother yet—the obligation’s poleetical, for I am trying every means to live well with my German neighbours—and, O Barrie, but it’s no easy!  To be sure, there are many exceptions.  And the whole of the above must be regarded as private—strictly private.  Breathe it not in Kirriemuir: tell it not to the daughters of Dundee!  What a nice extract this would make for the daily papers! and how it would facilitate my position here! . . .</p>

                     <p>This is Sunday, the Lord’s Day.  ‘The hour of attack approaches.’  And it is a singular consideration what I risk; I may yet be the subject of a tract, and a good tract too—such as one which I remember reading with recreant awe and rising hair in my youth, of a boy who was a very good boy, and went to Sunday Schule, and one day kipped from it, and went and actually bathed, and was dashed over a waterfall, and he was the only son of his mother, and she was a widow.  A dangerous trade, that, and one that I have to practise.  I’ll put in a word when I get home again, to tell you whether I’m killed or not.  ‘Accident in the (Paper) Hunting Field: death of a notorious author.  We deeply regret to announce the death of the most unpopular man in Samoa, who broke his neck at the descent of Magagi, from the misconduct of his little raving lunatic of an old beast of a pony.  It is proposed to commemorate the incident by the erection of a suitable pile.  The design (by our local architect, Mr. Walker) is highly artificial, with a rich and voluminous Crockett at each corner, a small but impervious Barrièer at the entrance, an arch at the top, an Archer of a pleasing but solid character at the bottom; the colour will be genuine William-Black; and Lang, lang may the ladies sit wi’ their fans in their hands.’  Well, well, they may sit as they sat for me, and little they’ll reck, the ungrateful jauds!  Muckle they cared about Tusitala when they had him!  But now ye can see the difference; now, leddies, ye can repent, when ower late, o’ your former cauldness and what ye’ll perhaps allow me to ca’ your <hi rend="italic">tepeedity</hi>!  He was beautiful as the day, but his day is done!  And perhaps, as he was maybe gettin’ a wee thing fly-blawn, it’s nane too shüne.</p>

                     <p>Well, sir, I have escaped the dangerous conjunction of the widow’s only son and the Sabbath Day.  We had a most enjoyable time, and Lloyd and I were 3 and 4 to arrive; I will not tell here what interval had elapsed between our arrival and the arrival of 1 and 2; the question, sir, is otiose and malign; it deserves, it shall have no answer.  And now without further delay to the main purpose of this hasty note.  We received and we have already in fact distributed the gorgeous fahbrics of Kirriemuir.  Whether from the splendour of the robes themselves, or from the direct nature of the compliments with which you had directed us to accompany the presentations, one young lady blushed as she received the proofs of your munificence. . . . Bad ink, and the dregs of it at that, but the heart in the right place.  Still very cordially interested in my Barrie and wishing him well through his sickness, which is of the body, and long defended from mine, which is of the head, and by the impolite might be described as idiocy.  The whole head is useless, and the whole sitting part painful: reason, the recent Paper Chase.</p>
                     <p>There was racing and chasing in Vailile plantation,<lb/>      And vastly we enjoyed it,<lb/>But, alas! for the state of my foundation,<lb/>      For it wholly has destroyed it.</p>

                     <p>She went to the graveyard<lb/>To see him get him buried,<lb/>And when she came back<lb/>The Deil had got merried.</p>
                     <p>It now remains to inform you that I have taken what we call here ‘German offence’ at not receiving cards, and that the only reparation I will accept is that Mrs. Barrie shall incontinently upon the receipt of this Take and Bring you to Vailima in order to apologise and be pardoned for this offence.  The commentary of Tamaitai upon the event was brief but pregnant: ‘Well, it’s a comfort our guest-room is furnished for two.’</p>
                     <p>This letter, about nothing, has already endured too long.  I shall just present the family to Mrs. Barrie—Tamaitai, Tamaitai Matua, Teuila, Palema, Loia, and with an extra low bow, Yours,</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR JAMES PAYN,—I hear from Lang that you are unwell, and it reminds me of two circumstances: First, that it is a very long time since you had the exquisite pleasure of hearing from me; and second, that I have been very often unwell myself, and sometimes had to thank you for a grateful anodyne.</p>
                     <p>They are not good, the circumstances, to write an anodyne letter.  The hills and my house at less than (boom) a minute’s interval quake with thunder; and though I cannot hear that part of it, shells are falling thick into the fort of Luatuanu’u (boom).  It is my friends of the <hi rend="italic">Curaçoa</hi>, the <hi rend="italic">Falke</hi>, and the <hi rend="italic">Bussard</hi> bombarding (after all these—boom—months) the rebels of Atua.  (Boom-boom.)  It is most distracting in itself; and the thought of the poor devils in their fort (boom) with their bits of rifles far from pleasant.  (Boom-boom.)  You can see how quick it goes, and I’ll say no more about Mr. Bow-wow, only you must understand the perpetual accompaniment of this discomfortable sound, and make allowances for the value of my copy.  It is odd, though, I can well remember, when the Franco-Prussian war began, and I was in Eilean Earraid, far enough from the sound of the loudest cannonade, I could <hi rend="italic">hear</hi> the shots fired, and I felt the pang in my breast of a man struck.  It was sometimes so distressing, so instant, that I lay in the heather on the top of the island, with my face hid, kicking my heels for agony.  And now, when I can hear the actual concussion of the air and hills, when I <hi rend="italic">know</hi> personally the people who stand exposed to it, I am able to go on <hi rend="italic">tant bien que mal</hi> with a letter to James Payn!  The blessings of age, though mighty small, are tangible.  I have heard a great deal of them since I came into the world, and now that I begin to taste of them—Well!  But this is one, that people do get cured of the excess of sensibility; and I had as lief these people were shot at as myself—or almost, for then I should have some of the fun, such as it is.</p>
                     <p>You are to conceive me, then, sitting in my little gallery room, shaken by these continual spasms of cannon, and with my eye more or less singly fixed on the imaginary figure of my dear James Payn.  I try to see him in bed; no go.  I see him instead jumping up in his room in Waterloo Place (where <hi rend="italic">ex hypothesi</hi> he is not), sitting on the table, drawing out a very black briar-root pipe, and beginning to talk to a slim and ill-dressed visitor in a voice that is good to hear and with a smile that is pleasant to see.  (After a little more than half an hour, the voice that was ill to hear has ceased, the cannonade is over.)  And I am thinking how I can get an answering smile wafted over so many leagues of land and water, and can find no way.</p>
                     <p>I have always been a great visitor of the sick; and one of the sick I visited was W. E. Henley, which did not make very tedious visits, so I’ll not get off much purgatory for them.  That was in the Edinburgh Infirmary, the old one, the true one, with Georgius Secundus standing and pointing his toe in a niche of the façade; and a mighty fine building it was!  And I remember one winter’s afternoon, in that place of misery, that Henley and I chanced to fall in talk about James Payn himself.  I am wishing you could have heard that talk!  I think that would make you smile.  We had mixed you up with John Payne, for one thing, and stood amazed at your extraordinary, even painful, versatility; and for another, we found ourselves each students so well prepared for examinations on the novels of the real Mackay.  Perhaps, after all, this is worth something in life—to have given so much pleasure to a pair so different in every way as were Henley and I, and to be talked of with so much interest by two such (beg pardon) clever lads!</p>
                     <p>The cheerful Lang has neglected to tell me what is the matter with you; so, I’m sorry to say, I am cut off from all the customary consolations.  I can’t say, ‘Think how much worse it would be if you had a broken leg!’ when you may have the crushing repartee up your sleeve, ‘But it is my leg that is broken.’  This is a pity.  But there are consolations.  You are an Englishman (I believe); you are a man of letters; you have never been made C.B.; your hair was not red; you have played cribbage and whist; you did not play either the fiddle or the banjo; you were never an æsthete; you never contributed to —<hi rend="italic">’s Journal</hi>; your name is not Jabez Balfour; you are totally unconnected with the Army and Navy departments; I understand you to have lived within your income—why, cheer up! here are many legitimate causes of congratulation.  I seem to be writing an obituary notice.  <hi rend="italic">Absit omen</hi>!  But I feel very sure that these considerations will have done you more good than medicine.</p>
                     <p>By the by, did you ever play piquet?  I have fallen a victim to this debilitating game.  It is supposed to be scientific; God save the mark, what self-deceivers men are!  It is distinctly less so than cribbage.  But how fascinating!  There is such material opulence about it, such vast ambitions may be realised—and are not; it may be called the Monte Cristo of games.  And the thrill with which you take five cards partakes of the nature of lust—and you draw four sevens and a nine, and the seven and nine of a suit that you discarded, and O! but the world is a desert!  You may see traces of discouragement in my letter: all due to piquet!  There has been a disastrous turn of the luck against me; a month or two ago I was two thousand ahead; now, and for a week back, I have been anything from four thousand eight hundred to five thousand two hundred astern.  If I have a sixième, my beast of a partner has a septième; and if I have three aces, three kings, three queens, and three knaves (excuse the slight exaggeration), the devil holds quatorze of tens!—I remain, my dear James Payn, your sincere and obliged friend—old friend let me say,</p>

                     <p>DEAR MISS MIDDLETON,—Your letter has been like the drawing up of a curtain.  Of course I remember you very well, and the Skye terrier to which you refer—a heavy, dull, fatted, graceless creature he grew up to be—was my own particular pet.  It may amuse you, perhaps, as much as ‘The Inn’ amused me, if I tell you what made this dog particularly mine.  My father was the natural god of all the dogs in our house, and poor Jura took to him of course.  Jura was stolen, and kept in prison somewhere for more than a week, as I remember.  When he came back Smeoroch had come and taken my father’s heart from him.  He took his stand like a man, and positively never spoke to my father again from that day until the day of his death.  It was the only sign of character he ever showed.  I took him up to my room and to be my dog in consequence, partly because I was sorry for him, and partly because I admired his dignity in misfortune.</p>
                     <p>With best regards and thanks for having reminded me of so many pleasant days, old acquaintances, dead friends, and—what is perhaps as pathetic as any of them—dead dogs, I remain, yours truly,</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR CHARLES,—. . . Well, there is no more Edmund Baxter now; and I think I may say I know how you feel.  He was one of the best, the kindest, and the most genial men I ever knew.  I shall always remember his brisk, cordial ways and the essential goodness which he showed me whenever we met with gratitude.  And the always is such a little while now!  He is another of the landmarks gone; when it comes to my own turn to lay my weapons down, I shall do so with thankfulness and fatigue; and whatever be my destiny afterward, I shall be glad to lie down with my fathers in honour.  It is human at least, if not divine.  And these deaths make me think of it with an ever greater readiness.  Strange that you should be beginning a new life, when I, who am a little your junior, am thinking of the end of mine.  But I have had hard lines; I have been so long waiting for death, I have unwrapped my thoughts from about life so long, that I have not a filament left to hold by; I have done my fiddling so long under Vesuvius, that I have almost forgotten to play, and can only wait for the eruption, and think it long of coming.  Literally, no man has more wholly outlived life than I.  And still it’s good fun.</p>

                     <p>[<hi rend="italic">Vailima</hi>, <hi rend="italic">September</hi> 1894.]</p>
                     <p>DEAR BOB,—You are in error about the Picts.  They were a Gaelic race, spoke a Celtic tongue, and we have no evidence that I know of that they were blacker than other Celts.  The Balfours, I take it, were plainly Celts; their name shows it—the ‘cold croft,’ it means; so does their country.  Where the <hi rend="italic">black</hi> Scotch come from nobody knows; but I recognise with you the fact that the whole of Britain is rapidly and progressively becoming more pigmented; already in one man’s life I can decidedly trace a difference in the children about a school door.  But colour is not an essential part of a man or a race.  Take my Polynesians, an Asiatic people probably from the neighbourhood of the Persian gulf.  They range through any amount of shades, from the burnt hue of the Low Archipelago islander, which seems half negro, to the ‘bleached’ pretty women of the Marquesas (close by on the map), who come out for a festival no darker than an Italian; their colour seems to vary directly with the degree of exposure to the sun.  And, as with negroes, the babes are born white; only it should seem a <hi rend="italic">little sack</hi> of pigment at the lower part of the spine, which presently spreads over the whole field.  Very puzzling.  But to return.  The Picts furnish to-day perhaps a third of the population of Scotland, say another third for Scots and Britons, and the third for Norse and Angles is a bad third.  Edinburgh was a Pictish place.  But the fact is, we don’t know their frontiers.  Tell some of your journalist friends with a good style to popularise old Skene; or say your prayers, and read him for yourself; he was a Great Historian, and I was his blessed clerk, and did not know it; and you will not be in a state of grace about the Picts till you have studied him.  J. Horne Stevenson (do you know him?) is working this up with me, and the fact is—it’s not interesting to the public—but it’s interesting, and very interesting, in itself, and just now very embarrassing—this rural parish supplied Glasgow with such a quantity of Stevensons in the beginning of last century!  There is just a link wanting; and we might be able to go back to the eleventh century, always undistinguished, but clearly traceable.  When I say just a link, I guess I may be taken to mean a dozen.  What a singular thing is this undistinguished perpetuation of a family throughout the centuries, and the sudden bursting forth of character and capacity that began with our grandfather!  But as I go on in life, day by day, I become more of a bewildered child; I cannot get used to this world, to procreation, to heredity, to sight, to hearing; the commonest things are a burthen.  The prim obliterated polite face of life, and the broad, bawdy, and orgiastic—or mænadic—foundations, form a spectacle to which no habit reconciles me; and ‘I could wish my days to be bound each to each’ by the same open-mouthed wonder.  They <hi rend="italic">are</hi> anyway, and whether I wish it or not.</p>
                     <p>I remember very well your attitude to life, this conventional surface of it.  You had none of that curiosity for the social stage directions, the trivial <hi rend="italic">ficelles</hi> of the business; it is simian, but that is how the wild youth of man is captured; you wouldn’t imitate, hence you kept free—a wild dog, outside the kennel—and came dam’ near starving for your pains.  The key to the business is of course the belly; difficult as it is to keep that in view in the zone of three miraculous meals a day in which we were brought up.  Civilisation has become reflex with us; you might think that hunger was the name of the best sauce; but hunger to the cold solitary under a bush of a rainy night is the name of something quite different.  I defend civilisation for the thing it is, for the thing it has <hi rend="italic">come</hi> to be, the standpoint of a real old Tory.  My ideal would be the Female Clan.  But how can you turn these crowding dumb multitudes <hi rend="italic">back</hi>?  They don’t do anything <hi rend="italic">because</hi>; they do things, write able articles, stitch shoes, dig, from the purely simian impulse.  Go and reason with monkeys!</p>
                     <p>No, I am right about Jean Lillie.  Jean Lillie, our double great-grandmother, the daughter of David Lillie, sometime Deacon of the Wrights, married, first, Alan Stevenson, who died May 26, 1774, ‘at Santt Kittes of a fiver,’ by whom she had Robert Stevenson, born 8th June 1772; and, second, in May or June 1787, Thomas Smith, a widower, and already the father of our grandmother.  This improbable double connection always tends to confuse a student of the family, Thomas Smith being doubly our great-grandfather.</p>
                     <p>I looked on the perpetuation of our honoured name with veneration.  My mother collared one of the photos, of course; the other is stuck up on my wall as the chief of our sept.  Do you know any of the Gaelic-Celtic sharps? you might ask what the name means.  It puzzles me.  I find a <hi rend="italic">M‘Stein</hi> and a <hi rend="italic">MacStephane</hi>; and our own great-grandfather always called himself Steenson, though he wrote it Stevenson.  There are at least three <hi rend="italic">places</hi> called Stevenson—<hi rend="italic">Stevenson</hi> in Cunningham, <hi rend="italic">Stevenson</hi> in Peebles, and <hi rend="italic">Stevenson</hi> in Haddington.  And it was not the Celtic trick, I understand, to call places after people.  I am going to write to Sir Herbert Maxwell about the name, but you might find some one.</p>
                     <p>Get the Anglo-Saxon heresy out of your head; they superimposed their language, they scarce modified the race; only in Berwickshire and Roxburgh have they very largely affected the place names.  The Scandinavians did much more to Scotland than the Angles.  The Saxons didn’t come.</p>
                     <p>Enough of this sham antiquarianism.  Yes, it is in the matter of the book, <ref target="#6855990405419608431_637-h-3.htm.xhtml#footnote359">[359]</ref> of course, that collaboration shows; as for the manner, it is superficially all mine, in the sense that the last copy is all in my hand.  Lloyd did not even put pen to paper in the Paris scenes or the Barbizon scene; it was no good; he wrote and often rewrote all the rest; I had the best service from him on the character of Nares.  You see, we had been just meeting the man, and his memory was full of the man’s words and ways.  And Lloyd is an impressionist, pure and simple.  The great difficulty of collaboration is that you can’t explain what you mean.  I know what kind of effect I mean a character to give—what kind of <hi rend="italic">tache</hi> he is to make; but how am I to tell my collaborator in words?  Hence it was necessary to say, ‘Make him So-and-so’; and this was all right for Nares and Pinkerton and Loudon Dodd, whom we both knew, but for Bellairs, for instance—a man with whom I passed ten minutes fifteen years ago—what was I to say? and what could Lloyd do?  I, as a personal artist, can begin a character with only a haze in my head, but how if I have to translate the haze into words before I begin?  In our manner of collaboration (which I think the only possible—I mean that of one person being responsible, and giving the <hi rend="italic">coup de pouce</hi> to every part of the work) I was spared the obviously hopeless business of trying to explain to my collaborator what <hi rend="italic">style</hi> I wished a passage to be treated in.  These are the times that illustrate to a man the inadequacy of spoken language.  Now—to be just to written language—I can (or could) find a language for my every mood, but how could I <hi rend="italic">tell</hi> any one beforehand what this effect was to be, which it would take every art that I possessed, and hours and hours of deliberate labour and selection and rejection, to produce?  These are the impossibilities of collaboration.  Its immediate advantage is to focus two minds together on the stuff, and to produce in consequence an extraordinarily greater richness of purview, consideration, and invention.  The hardest chapter of all was ‘Cross Questions and Crooked Answers.’  You would not believe what that cost us before it assumed the least unity and colour.  Lloyd wrote it at least thrice, and I at least five times—this is from memory.  And was that last chapter worth the trouble it cost?  Alas, that I should ask the question!  Two classes of men—the artist and the educationalist—are sworn, on soul and conscience, not to ask it.  You get an ordinary, grinning, red-headed boy, and you have to educate him.  Faith supports you; you give your valuable hours, the boy does not seem to profit, but that way your duty lies, for which you are paid, and you must persevere.  Education has always seemed to me one of the few possible and dignified ways of life.  A sailor, a shepherd, a schoolmaster—to a less degree, a soldier—and (I don’t know why, upon my soul, except as a sort of schoolmaster’s unofficial assistant, and a kind of acrobat in tights) an artist, almost exhaust the category.</p>
                     <p>If I had to begin again—I know not—<hi rend="italic">si jeunesse savait</hi>, <hi rend="italic">si vieillesse pouvait</hi> . . . I know not at all—I believe I should try to honour Sex more religiously.  The worst of our education is that Christianity does not recognise and hallow Sex.  It looks askance at it, over its shoulder, oppressed as it is by reminiscences of hermits and Asiatic self-tortures.  It is a terrible hiatus in our modern religions that they cannot see and make venerable that which they ought to see first and hallow most.  Well, it is so; I cannot be wiser than my generation.</p>
                     <p>But no doubt there is something great in the half-success that has attended the effort of turning into an emotional religion, Bald Conduct, without any appeal, or almost none, to the figurative, mysterious, and constitutive facts of life.  Not that conduct is not constitutive, but dear! it’s dreary!  On the whole, conduct is better dealt with on the cast-iron ‘gentleman’ and duty formula, with as little fervour and poetry as possible; stoical and short.</p>
                     <p>. . . There is a new something or other in the wind, which exercises me hugely: anarchy,—I mean, anarchism.  People who (for pity’s sake) commit dastardly murders very basely, die like saints, and leave beautiful letters behind ’em (did you see Vaillant to his daughter? it was the New Testament over again); people whose conduct is inexplicable to me, and yet their spiritual life higher than that of most.  This is just what the early Christians must have seemed to the Romans.  Is this, then, a new <hi rend="italic">drive</hi> 
                        <ref target="#6855990405419608431_637-h-3.htm.xhtml#footnote361">[361]</ref> among the monkeys?  Mind you, Bob, if they go on being martyred a few years more, the gross, dull, not unkindly bourgeois may get tired or ashamed or afraid of going on martyring; and the anarchists come out at the top just like the early Christians.  That is, of course, they will step into power as a <hi rend="italic">personnel</hi>, but God knows what they may believe when they come to do so; it can’t be stranger or more improbable than what Christianity had come to be by the same time.</p>
                     <p>Your letter was easily read, the pagination presented no difficulty, and I read it with much edification and gusto.  To look back, and to stereotype one bygone humour—what a hopeless thing!  The mind runs ever in a thousand eddies like a river between cliffs.  You (the ego) are always spinning round in it, east, west, north, and south.  You are twenty years old, and forty, and five, and the next moment you are freezing at an imaginary eighty; you are never the plain forty-four that you should be by dates.  (The most philosophical language is the Gaelic, which has <hi rend="italic">no present tense</hi>—and the most useless.)  How, then, to choose some former age, and stick there?</p>

                     <p>I find it in the forms Stevinetoun, Stevensoune, Stevensonne, Stenesone, Stewinsoune, M’Stein, and MacStephane.  My family, and (as far as I can gather) the majority of the inglorious clan, hailed from the borders of Cunningham and Renfrew, and the upper waters of the Clyde.  In the Barony of Bothwell was the seat of the laird Stevenson of Stevenson; but, as of course you know, there is a parish in Cunningham and places in Peebles and Haddington bearing the same name.</p>
                     <p>If you can at all help me, you will render me a real service which I wish I could think of some manner to repay.—Believe me, yours truly,</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR CUMMY,—So I hear you are ailing?  Think shame to yourself!  So you think there is nothing better to be done with time than that? and be sure we can all do much ourselves to decide whether we are to be ill or well! like a man on the gymnastic bars.  We are all pretty well.  As for me, there is nothing the matter with me in the world, beyond the disgusting circumstance that I am not so young as once I was.  Lloyd has a gymnastic machine, and practises upon it every morning for an hour: he is beginning to be a kind of young Samson.  Austin grows fat and brown, and gets on not so ill with his lessons, and my mother is in great price.  We are having knock-me-down weather for heat; I never remember it so hot before, and I fancy it means we are to have a hurricane again this year, I think; since we came here, we have not had a single gale of wind!  The Pacific is but a child to the North Sea; but when she does get excited, and gets up and girds herself, she can do something good.  We have had a very interesting business here.  I helped the chiefs who were in prison; and when they were set free, what should they do but offer to make a part of my road for me out of gratitude?  Well, I was ashamed to refuse, and the trumps dug my road for me, and put up this inscription on a board:—</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR JAMES PAYN,—I am asked to relate to you a little incident of domestic life at Vailima.  I had read your <hi rend="italic">Gleams of Memory</hi>, No. 1; it then went to my wife, to Osbourne, to the cousin that is within my gates, and to my respected amanuensis, Mrs. Strong.  Sunday approached.  In the course of the afternoon I was attracted to the great ’all—the winders is by Vanderputty, which upon entering I beheld a memorable scene.  The floor was bestrewn with the forms of midshipmen from the <hi rend="italic">Curaçoa</hi>—‘boldly say a wilderness of gunroom’—and in the midst of this sat Mrs. Strong throned on the sofa and reading aloud <hi rend="italic">Gleams of Memory</hi>.  They had just come the length of your immortal definition of boyhood in the concrete, and I had the pleasure to see the whole party dissolve under its influence with inextinguishable laughter.  I thought this was not half bad for arthritic gout!  Depend upon it, sir, when I go into the arthritic gout business, I shall be done with literature, or at least with the funny business.  It is quite true I have my battlefields behind me.  I have done perhaps as much work as anybody else under the most deplorable conditions.  But two things fall to be noticed: In the first place, I never was in actual pain; and in the second, I was never funny.  I’ll tell you the worst day that I remember.  I had a hæmorrhage, and was not allowed to speak; then, induced by the devil, or an errant doctor, I was led to partake of that bowl which neither cheers nor inebriates—the castor-oil bowl.  Now, when castor-oil goes right, it is one thing; but when it goes wrong, it is another.  And it went <hi rend="italic">wrong</hi> with me that day.  The waves of faintness and nausea succeeded each other for twelve hours, and I do feel a legitimate pride in thinking that I stuck to my work all through and wrote a good deal of Admiral Guinea (which I might just as well not have written for all the reward it ever brought me) in spite of the barbarous bad conditions.  I think that is my great boast; and it seems a little thing alongside of your <hi rend="italic">Gleams of Memory</hi> illustrated by spasms of arthritic gout.  We really should have an order of merit in the trade of letters.  For valour, Scott would have had it; Pope too; myself on the strength of that castor-oil; and James Payn would be a Knight Commander.  The worst of it is, though Lang tells me you exhibit the courage of Huish, that not even an order can alleviate the wretched annoyance of the business.  I have always said that there is nothing like pain; toothache, dumb-ague, arthritic gout, it does not matter what you call it, if the screw is put upon the nerves sufficiently strong, there is nothing left in heaven or in earth that can interest the sufferer.  Still, even to this there is the consolation that it cannot last for ever.  Either you will be relieved and have a good hour again before the sun goes down, or else you will be liberated.  It is something after all (although not much) to think that you are leaving a brave example; that other literary men love to remember, as I am sure they will love to remember, everything about you—your sweetness, your brightness, your helpfulness to all of us, and in particular those one or two really adequate and noble papers which you have been privileged to write during these last years.—With the heartiest and kindest good-will, I remain, yours ever,</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR EELES,—The hand, as you will perceive (and also the spelling!), is Teuila’s, but the scrannel voice is what remains of Tusitala’s.  First of all, for business.  When you go to London you are to charter a hansom cab and proceed to the Museum.  It is particular fun to do this on Sundays when the Monument is shut up.  Your cabman expostulates with you, you persist.  The cabman drives up in front of the closed gates and says, ‘I told you so, sir.’  You breathe in the porter’s ears the mystic name of <hi rend="italic">Colvin</hi>, and he immediately unfolds the iron barrier.  You drive in, and doesn’t your cabman think you’re a swell.  A lord mayor is nothing to it.  Colvin’s door is the only one in the eastern gable of the building.  Send in your card to him with ‘From R. L. S.’ in the corner, and the machinery will do the rest.  Henry James’s address is 34 De Vere Mansions West.  I cannot remember where the place is; I cannot even remember on which side of the park.  But it’s one of those big Cromwell Road-looking deserted thoroughfares out west in Kensington or Bayswater, or between the two; and anyway, Colvin will be able to put you on the direct track for Henry James.  I do not send formal introductions, as I have taken the liberty to prepare both of them for seeing you already.</p>
                     <p>Hoskyn is staying with us.</p>
                     <p>It is raining dismally.  The Curaçoa track is hardly passable, but it must be trod to-morrow by the degenerate feet of their successor the Wallaroos.  I think it a very good account of these last that we don’t think them either deformed or habitual criminals—they seem to be a kindly lot.</p>
                     <p>The doctor will give you all the gossip.  I have preferred in this letter to stick to the strictly solid and necessary.  With kind messages from all in the house to all in the wardroom, all in the gunroom, and (may we dare to breathe it) to him who walks abaft, believe me, my dear Eeles, yours ever,</p>
                     <p>R. L. Stevenson.</p>

                     <p>DEAR SIR HERBERT,—Thank you very much for your long and kind letter.  I shall certainly take your advice and call my cousin, the Lyon King, into council.  It is certainly a very interesting subject, though I don’t suppose it can possibly lead to anything, this connection between the Stevensons and M’Gregors.  Alas! your invitation is to me a mere derision.  My chances of visiting Heaven are about as valid as my chances of visiting Monreith.  Though I should like well to see you, shrunken into a cottage, a literary Lord of Ravenscraig.  I suppose it is the inevitable doom of all those who dabble in Scotch soil; but really your fate is the more blessed.  I cannot conceive anything more grateful to me, or more amusing or more picturesque, than to live in a cottage outside your own park-walls.—With renewed thanks, believe me, dear Sir Herbert, yours very truly,</p>

                     <p>MY DEAR LANG,—For the portrait of Braxfield, much thanks!  It is engraved from the same Raeburn portrait that I saw in ’76 or ’77 with so extreme a gusto that I have ever since been Braxfield’s humble servant, and am now trying, as you know, to stick him into a novel.  Alas! one might as well try to stick in Napoleon.  The picture shall be framed and hung up in my study.  Not only as a memento of you, but as a perpetual encouragement to do better with his Lordship.  I have not yet received the transcripts.  They must be very interesting.  Do you know, I picked up the other day an old <hi rend="italic">Longman’s</hi>, where I found an article of yours that I had missed, about Christie’s?  I read it with great delight.  The year ends with us pretty much as it began, among wars and rumours of wars, and a vast and splendid exhibition of official incompetence.—Yours ever,</p>

                     <p>I AM afraid, MY DEAR WEG, that this must be the result of bribery and corruption!  The volume to which the dedication stands as preface seems to me to stand alone in your work; it is so natural, so personal, so sincere, so articulate in substance, and what you always were sure of—so rich in adornment.</p>
                     <p>Let me speak first of the dedication.  I thank you for it from the heart.  It is beautifully said, beautifully and kindly felt; and I should be a churl indeed if I were not grateful, and an ass if I were not proud.  I remember when Symonds dedicated a book to me; I wrote and told him of ‘the pang of gratified vanity’ with which I had read it.  The pang was present again, but how much more sober and autumnal—like your volume.  Let me tell you a story, or remind you of a story.  In the year of grace something or other, anything between ’76 and ’78 I mentioned to you in my usual autobiographical and inconsiderate manner that I was hard up.  You said promptly that you had a balance at your banker’s, and could make it convenient to let me have a cheque, and I accepted and got the money—how much was it?—twenty or perhaps thirty pounds?  I know not—but it was a great convenience.  The same evening, or the next day, I fell in conversation (in my usual autobiographical and . . . see above) with a denizen of the Savile Club, name now gone from me, only his figure and a dim three-quarter view of his face remaining.  To him I mentioned that you had given me a loan, remarking easily that of course it didn’t matter to you.  Whereupon he read me a lecture, and told me how it really stood with you financially.  He was pretty serious; fearing, as I could not help perceiving, that I should take too light a view of the responsibility and the service (I was always thought too light—the irresponsible jester—you remember.  O, <hi rend="italic">quantum mutatus ab illo</hi>!)  If I remember rightly, the money was repaid before the end of the week—or, to be more exact and a trifle pedantic, the sennight—but the service has never been forgotten; and I send you back this piece of ancient history, <hi rend="italic">consule Planco</hi>, as a salute for your dedication, and propose that we should drink the health of the nameless one, who opened my eyes as to the true nature of what you did for me on that occasion.</p>
                     <p>But here comes my Amanuensis, so we’ll get on more swimmingly now.  You will understand perhaps that what so particularly pleased me in the new volume, what seems to me to have so personal and original a note, are the middle-aged pieces in the beginning.  The whole of them, I may say, though I must own an especial liking to—</p>
                     <p>‘I yearn not for the fighting fate,<lb/>   That holds and hath achieved;<lb/>I live to watch and meditate<lb/>   And dream—and be deceived.’</p>
                     <p>You take the change gallantly.  Not I, I must confess.  It is all very well to talk of renunciation, and of course it has to be done.  But, for my part, give me a roaring toothache!  I do like to be deceived and to dream, but I have very little use for either watching or meditation.  I was not born for age.  And, curiously enough, I seem to see a contrary drift in my work from that which is so remarkable in yours.  You are going on sedately travelling through your ages, decently changing with the years to the proper tune.  And here am I, quite out of my true course, and with nothing in my foolish elderly head but love-stories.  This must repose upon some curious distinction of temperaments.  I gather from a phrase, boldly autobiographical, that you are—well, not precisely growing thin.  Can that be the difference?</p>
                     <p>It is rather funny that this matter should come up just now, as I am at present engaged in treating a severe case of middle age in one of my stories—‘The Justice-Clerk.’  The case is that of a woman, and I think that I am doing her justice.  You will be interested, I believe, to see the difference in our treatments.  <hi rend="italic">Secreta Vitæ</hi>, comes nearer to the case of my poor Kirstie.  Come to think of it, Gosse, I believe the main distinction is that you have a family growing up around you, and I am a childless, rather bitter, very clear-eyed, blighted youth.  I have, in fact, lost the path that makes it easy and natural for you to descend the hill.  I am going at it straight.  And where I have to go down it is a precipice.</p>
                     <p>I must not forget to give you a word of thanks for <hi rend="italic">An English Village</hi>.  It reminds me strongly of Keats, which is enough to say; and I was particularly pleased with the petulant sincerity of the concluding sentiment.</p>
                     <p>Well, my dear Gosse, here’s wishing you all health and prosperity, as well as to the mistress and the bairns.  May you live long, since it seems as if you would continue to enjoy life.  May you write many more books as good as this one—only there’s one thing impossible, you can never write another dedication that can give the same pleasure to the vanished</p>

I did not hear your voice saying, “Hail Rui”; I thought then that you had gone, and that you had left me.  Rising up, I went to the beach to see your ship, and I could not see it.  I wept, then, until the night, telling myself continually, “Teriitera returns into his own country and leaves his dear Rui in grief, so that I suffer for him, and weep for him.”  I will not forget you in my memory.  Here is the thought: I desire to meet you again.  It is my dear Teriitera makes the only riches I desire in this world.  It is your eyes that I desire to see again.  It must be that your body and my body shall eat together at one table: there is what would make my heart content.  But now we are separated.  May God be with you all.  May His word and His mercy go with you, so that you may be well and we also, according to the words of Paul.</p>

                  <p>Updated editions will replace the previous one—the old editions will be renamed.</p>
                  <p>Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without permission and without paying copyright royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG™ concept and trademark. Project Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the trademark license is very easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away—you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.</p>

                  <head>The Full Project Gutenberg License</head>
                  <p>PLEASE READ THIS BEFORE YOU DISTRIBUTE OR USE THIS WORK</p>
                  <p>To protect the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting the free distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work (or any other work associated in any way with the phrase “Project Gutenberg”), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project Gutenberg™ License available with this file or online at www.gutenberg.org/license.</p>
                  <p>Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works</p>
                  <p>1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg™ electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property (trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works in your possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project Gutenberg™ electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.</p>
                  <p>1.B. “Project Gutenberg” is a registered trademark. It may only be used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg™ electronic works even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project Gutenberg™ electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.</p>
                  <p>1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (“the Foundation” or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project Gutenberg™ electronic works. Nearly all the individual works in the collection are in the public domain in the United States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the United States and you are located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope that you will support the Project Gutenberg™ mission of promoting free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg™ works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg™ name associated with the work. You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg™ License when you share it without charge with others.</p>
                  <p>1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States, check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project Gutenberg™ work. The Foundation makes no representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any country other than the United States.</p>
                  <p>1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:</p>
                  <p>1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg™ License must appear prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg™ work (any work on which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” appears, or with which the phrase “Project Gutenberg” is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed, copied or distributed:</p>
                  <p>This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online at <ref target="https://www.gutenberg.org/">www.gutenberg.org</ref>. If you are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws of the country where you are located before using this eBook.</p>
                  <p>1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase “Project Gutenberg” associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg™ trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>
                  <p>1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg™ electronic work is posted with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms will be linked to the Project Gutenberg™ License for all works posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.</p>
                  <p>1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg™ License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg™.</p>
                  <p>1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project Gutenberg™ License.</p>
                  <p>1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary, compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg™ work in a format other than “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other format used in the official version posted on the official Project Gutenberg™ website (www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original “Plain Vanilla ASCII” or other form. Any alternate format must include the full Project Gutenberg™ License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.</p>
                  <p>1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying, performing, copying or distributing any Project Gutenberg™ works unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.</p>
                  <p>1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing access to or distributing Project Gutenberg™ electronic works provided that:</p>
                  <p>• You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from the use of Project Gutenberg™ works calculated using the method you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed to the owner of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark, but he has agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in Section 4, “Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation.”</p>
                  <p>• You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg™ License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg™ works.</p>
                  <p>• You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of receipt of the work.</p>
                  <p>• You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free distribution of Project Gutenberg™ works.</p>
                  <p>1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project Gutenberg™ electronic work or group of works on different terms than are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing from the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the manager of the Project Gutenberg™ trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.</p>
                  <p>1.F.</p>
                  <p>1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™ electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by your equipment.</p>
                  <p>1.F.2.

                  <p>Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™</p>
                  <p>Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.</p>
                  <p>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.</p>
                  <p>Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</p>
                  <p>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit 501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.</p>
                  <p>The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact</p>
                  <p>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</p>
                  <p>Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.</p>
                  <p>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit <ref target="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</ref>.</p>
                  <p>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate.</p>
                  <p>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</p>
                  <p>Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</p>
                  <p>Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works</p>
                  <p>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</p>
                  <p>Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</p>
                  <p>Most people start at our website which has the main PG search facility: <ref target="https://www.gutenberg.org/">www.gutenberg.org</ref>.</p>
                  <p>This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</p>
