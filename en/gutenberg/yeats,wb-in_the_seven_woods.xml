                  <l>But that great queen, who more than half the night</l>
                  <l>Had paced from door to fire and fire to door.</l>
                  <l>Though now in her old age, in her young age</l>
                  <l>She had been beautiful in that old way</l>
                  <l>That’s all but gone; for the proud heart is gone</l>
                  <l>And the fool heart of the counting-house fears all</l>
                  <l>But soft beauty and indolent desire.</l>
                  <l>She could have called over the rim of the world</l>
                  <l>Whatever woman’s lover had hit her fancy,</l>
                  <l>And yet had been great bodied and great limbed,</l>
                  <l>Fashioned to be the mother of strong children;</l>
                  <l>And she’d had lucky eyes and a high heart,</l>
                  <l>And wisdom that caught fire like the dried flax,</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>At need, and made her beautiful and fierce,</l>
                  <l>Sudden and laughing.</l>
                  <l>O unquiet heart,</l>
                  <l>Why do you praise another, praising her,</l>
                  <l>As if there were no tale but your own tale</l>
                  <l>Worth knitting to a measure of sweet sound?</l>
                  <l>Have I not bid you tell of that great queen</l>
                  <l>Who has been buried some two thousand years?</l>
                  <l>When night was at its deepest, a wild goose</l>
                  <l>Cried from the porter’s lodge, and with long clamour</l>
                  <l>Shook the ale horns and shields upon their hooks;</l>
                  <l>But the horse-boys slept on, as though some power</l>
                  <l>Had filled the house with Druid heaviness;</l>
                  <l>And wondering who of the many changing Sidhe</l>
                  <l>Had come as in the old times to counsel her,</l>
                  <l>Maeve walked, yet with slow footfall being old,</l>
                  <l>To that small chamber by the outer gate.</l>
                  <l>The porter slept although he sat upright</l>
                  <l>With still and stony limbs and open eyes.</l>
                  <l>Maeve waited, and when that ear-piercing noise</l>
                  <l/>
                  <l>Broke from his parted lips and broke again,</l>
                  <l>She laid a hand on either of his shoulders,</l>
                  <l>And shook him wide awake, and bid him say</l>
                  <l>Who of the wandering many-changing ones</l>
                  <l>Had troubled his sleep. But all he had to say</l>
                  <l>Was that, the air being heavy and the dogs</l>
                  <l>More still than they had been for a good month,</l>
                  <l>He had fallen asleep, and, though he had dreamed nothing,</l>
                  <l>He could remember when he had had fine dreams.</l>
                  <l>It was before the time of the great war</l>
                  <l>Over the White-Horned Bull, and the Brown Bull.</l>
                  <l>She turned away; he turned again to sleep</l>
                  <l>That no god troubled now, and, wondering</l>
                  <l>What matters were afoot among the Sidhe,</l>
                  <l>Maeve walked through that great hall, and with a sigh</l>
                  <l>Lifted the curtain of her sleeping room,</l>
                  <l>Remembering that she too had seemed divine</l>
                  <l>To many thousand eyes, and to her own</l>
                  <l/>
                  <l>One that the generations had long waited</l>
                  <l>That work too difficult for mortal hands</l>
                  <l>Might be accomplished. Bunching the curtain up</l>
                  <l>She saw her husband Ailell sleeping there,</l>
                  <l>And thought of days when he’d had a straight body,</l>
                  <l>And of that famous Fergus, Nessa’s husband,</l>
                  <l>Who had been the lover of her middle life.</l>
                  <l>Suddenly Ailell spoke out of his sleep,</l>
                  <l>And not with his own voice or a man’s voice,</l>
                  <l>But with the burning, live, unshaken voice</l>
                  <l>Of those that it may be can never age.</l>
                  <l>He said, ‘High Queen of Cruachan and Mag Ai</l>
                  <l>A king of the Great Plain would speak with you.’</l>
                  <l>And with glad voice Maeve answered him, ‘What King</l>
                  <l>Of the far wandering shadows has come to me?</l>
                  <l>As in the old days when they would come and go</l>
                  <l>About my threshold to counsel and to help.’</l>
                  <l>The parted lips replied, ‘I seek your help,</l>
                  <l>For I am Aengus and I am crossed in love.’</l>
                  <l/>
                  <l>‘How may a mortal whose life gutters out</l>
                  <l>Help them that wander with hand clasping hand</l>
                  <l>By rivers where nor rain nor hail has dimmed</l>
                  <l>Their haughty images, that cannot fade</l>
                  <l>Although their beauty’s like a hollow dream.’</l>
                  <l>‘I come from the undimmed rivers to bid you call</l>
                  <l>The children of the Maines out of sleep,</l>
                  <l>And set them digging into Anbual’s hill.</l>
                  <l>We shadows, while they uproot his earthy house,</l>
                  <l>Will overthrow his shadows and carry off</l>
                  <l>Caer, his blue eyed daughter that I love.</l>
                  <l>I helped your fathers when they built these walls</l>
                  <l>And I would have your help in my great need,</l>
                  <l>Queen of high Cruachan.’</l>
                  <l>‘I obey your will</l>
                  <l>With speedy feet and a most thankful heart:</l>
                  <l>For you have been, O Aengus of the birds,</l>
                  <l>Our giver of good counsel and good luck.’</l>
                  <l>And with a groan, as if the mortal breath</l>
                  <l>Could but awaken sadly upon lips</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>That happier breath had moved, her husband turned</l>
                  <l>Face downward, tossing in a troubled sleep;</l>
                  <l>But Maeve, and not with a slow feeble foot,</l>
                  <l>Came to the threshold of the painted house,</l>
                  <l>Where her grandchildren slept, and cried aloud,</l>
                  <l>Until the pillared dark began to stir</l>
                  <l>With shouting and the clang of unhooked arms.</l>
                  <l>She told them of the many-changing ones;</l>
                  <l>And all that night, and all through the next day</l>
                  <l>To middle night, they dug into the hill.</l>
                  <l>At middle night great cats with silver claws,</l>
                  <l>Bodies of shadow and blind eyes like pearls,</l>
                  <l>Came up out of the hole, and red-eared hounds</l>
                  <l>With long white bodies came out of the air</l>
                  <l>Suddenly, and ran at them and harried them.</l>
                  <l>The Maines’ children dropped their spades, and stood</l>
                  <l>With quaking joints and terror strucken faces,</l>
                  <l>Till Maeve called out, ‘These are but common men.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>The Maines’ children have not dropped their spades</l>
                  <l>Because Earth crazy for its broken power</l>
                  <l>Casts up a show and the winds answer it</l>
                  <l>With holy shadows.’ Her high heart was glad,</l>
                  <l>And when the uproar ran along the grass</l>
                  <l>She followed with light footfall in the midst,</l>
                  <l>Till it died out where an old thorn tree stood.</l>
                  <l>Friend of these many years, you too had stood</l>
                  <l>With equal courage in that whirling rout;</l>
                  <l>For you, although you’ve not her wandering heart,</l>
                  <l>Have all that greatness, and not hers alone.</l>
                  <l>For there is no high story about queens</l>
                  <l>In any ancient book but tells of you,</l>
                  <l>And when I’ve heard how they grew old and died</l>
                  <l>Or fell into unhappiness I’ve said;</l>
                  <l>‘She will grow old and die and she has wept!’</l>
                  <l>And when I’d write it out anew, the words,</l>
                  <l>Half crazy with the thought, She too has wept!</l>
                  <l>Outrun the measure.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>I’d tell of that great queen</l>
                  <l>Who stood amid a silence by the thorn</l>
                  <l>Until two lovers came out of the air</l>
                  <l>With bodies made out of soft fire. The one</l>
                  <l>About whose face birds wagged their fiery wings</l>
                  <l>Said, ‘Aengus and his sweetheart give their thanks</l>
                  <l>To Maeve and to Maeve’s household, owing all</l>
                  <l>In owing them the bride-bed that gives peace.’</l>
                  <l>Then Maeve, ‘O Aengus, Master of all lovers,</l>
                  <l>A thousand years ago you held high talk</l>
                  <l>With the first kings of many pillared Cruachan.</l>
                  <l>O when will you grow weary.’</l>
                  <l>They had vanished,</l>
                  <l>But out of the dark air over her head there came</l>
                  <l>A murmur of soft words and meeting lips.</l>
               </lg>
            </div>
            <div type="div2">
               <head>Baile And Aillinn</head>
               <lg>
                  <l>Argument. Baile and Aillinn were lovers, but</l>
                  <l>Aengus, the Master of Love, wishing them to be</l>
                  <l>happy in his own land among the dead, told to</l>
                  <l>each a story of the other’s death, so that their</l>
                  <l>hearts were broken and they died.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>I hardly hear the curlew cry,</l>
                  <l>Nor the grey rush when wind is high,</l>
                  <l>Before my thoughts begin to run</l>
                  <l>On the heir of Ulad, Buan’s son,</l>
                  <l>Baile who had the honey mouth,</l>
                  <l>And that mild woman of the south,</l>
                  <l>Aillinn, who was King Lugaid’s heir.</l>
                  <l>Their love was never drowned in care</l>
                  <l>Of this or that thing, nor grew cold</l>
                  <l>Because their bodies had grown old;</l>
                  <l>Being forbid to marry on earth</l>
                  <l>They blossomed to immortal mirth.</l>
                  <l>About the time when Christ was born,</l>
                  <l>When the long wars for the White Horn</l>
                  <l>And the Brown Bull had not yet come,</l>
                  <l>Young Baile Honey-Mouth, whom some</l>
                  <l>Called rather Baile Little-Land,</l>
                  <l>Rode out of Emain with a band</l>
                  <l>Of harpers and young men, and they</l>
                  <l>Imagined, as they struck the way</l>
                  <l>To many pastured Muirthemne,</l>
                  <l>That all things fell out happily</l>
                  <l>And there, for all that fools had said,</l>
                  <l>Baile and Aillinn would be wed.</l>
                  <l>They found an old man running there,</l>
                  <l>He had ragged long grass-yellow hair;</l>
                  <l>He had knees that stuck out of his hose;</l>
                  <l>He had puddle water in his shoes;</l>
                  <l>He had half a cloak to keep him dry;</l>
                  <l>Although he had a squirrel’s eye.</l>
                  <l>O wandering birds and rushy beds</l>
                  <l>You put such folly in our heads</l>
                  <l>With all this crying in the wind</l>
                  <l>No common love is to our mind,</l>
                  <l>And our poor Kate or Nan is less</l>
                  <l>Than any whose unhappiness</l>
                  <l>Awoke the harp strings long ago.</l>
                  <l>Yet they that know all things but know</l>
                  <l>That all life had to give us is</l>
                  <l>A child’s laughter, a woman’s kiss.</l>
                  <l/>
                  <l>Who was it put so great a scorn</l>
                  <l>In the grey reeds that night and morn</l>
                  <l>Are trodden and broken by the herds,</l>
                  <l>And in the light bodies of birds</l>
                  <l>That north wind tumbles to and fro</l>
                  <l>And pinches among hail and snow?</l>
                  <l>That runner said, ‘I am from the south;</l>
                  <l>I run to Baile Honey-Mouth</l>
                  <l>To tell him how the girl Aillinn</l>
                  <l>Rode from the country of her kin</l>
                  <l>And old and young men rode with her:</l>
                  <l>For all that country had been astir</l>
                  <l>If anybody half as fair</l>
                  <l>Had chosen a husband anywhere</l>
                  <l>But where it could see her every day.</l>
                  <l>When they had ridden a little way</l>
                  <l>An old man caught the horse’s head</l>
                  <l>With “You must home again and wed</l>
                  <l>With somebody in your own land.”</l>
                  <l>A young man cried and kissed her hand</l>
                  <l>“O lady, wed with one of us;”</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>And when no face grew piteous</l>
                  <l>For any gentle thing she spake</l>
                  <l>She fell and died of the heart-break.’</l>
                  <l>Because a lover’s heart’s worn out</l>
                  <l>Being tumbled and blown about</l>
                  <l>By its own blind imagining,</l>
                  <l>And will believe that anything</l>
                  <l>That is bad enough to be true, is true,</l>
                  <l>Baile’s heart was broken in two;</l>
                  <l>And he being laid upon green boughs</l>
                  <l>Was carried to the goodly house</l>
                  <l>Where the Hound of Ulad sat before</l>
                  <l>The brazen pillars of his door;</l>
                  <l>His face bowed low to weep the end</l>
                  <l>Of the harper’s daughter and her friend;</l>
                  <l>For although years had passed away</l>
                  <l>He always wept them on that day,</l>
                  <l>For on that day they had been betrayed;</l>
                  <l>And now that Honey-Mouth is laid</l>
                  <l>Under a cairn of sleepy stone</l>
                  <l>Before his eyes, he has tears for none,</l>
                  <l/>
                  <l>Although he is carrying stone, but two</l>
                  <l>For whom the cairn’s but heaped anew.</l>
                  <l>We hold because our memory is</l>
                  <l>So full of that thing and of this</l>
                  <l>That out of sight is out of mind.</l>
                  <l>But the grey rush under the wind</l>
                  <l>And the grey bird with crooked bill</l>
                  <l>Have such long memories that they still</l>
                  <l>Remember Deirdre and her man,</l>
                  <l>And when we walk with Kate or Nan</l>
                  <l>About the windy water side</l>
                  <l>Our heart can hear the voices chide.</l>
                  <l>How could we be so soon content</l>
                  <l>Who know the way that Naoise went?</l>
                  <l>And they have news of Deirdre’s eyes</l>
                  <l>Who being lovely was so wise,</l>
                  <l>Ah wise, my heart knows well how wise.</l>
                  <l>Now had that old gaunt crafty one,</l>
                  <l>Gathering his cloak about him, run</l>
                  <l>Where Aillinn rode with waiting maids</l>
                  <l>Who amid leafy lights and shades</l>
                  <l/>
                  <l>Dreamed of the hands that would unlace</l>
                  <l>Their bodices in some dim place</l>
                  <l>When they had come to the marriage bed;</l>
                  <l>And harpers pondering with bowed head</l>
                  <l>A music that had thought enough</l>
                  <l>Of the ebb of all things to make love</l>
                  <l>Grow gentle without sorrowings;</l>
                  <l>And leather-coated men with slings</l>
                  <l>Who peered about on every side;</l>
                  <l>And amid leafy light he cried,</l>
                  <l>‘He is well out of wind and wave,</l>
                  <l>They have heaped the stones above his grave</l>
                  <l>In Muirthemne and over it</l>
                  <l>In changeless Ogham letters writ</l>
                  <l>Baile that was of Rury’s seed.</l>
                  <l>But the gods long ago decreed</l>
                  <l>No waiting maid should ever spread</l>
                  <l>Baile and Aillinn’s marriage bed,</l>
                  <l>For they should clip and clip again</l>
                  <l>Where wild bees hive on the Great Plain.</l>
                  <l>Therefore it is but little news</l>
                  <l>That put this hurry in my shoes.’</l>
                  <l/>
                  <l>And hurrying to the south he came</l>
                  <l>To that high hill the herdsmen name</l>
                  <l>The Hill Seat of Leighin, because</l>
                  <l>Some god or king had made the laws</l>
                  <l>That held the land together there,</l>
                  <l>In old times among the clouds of the air.</l>
                  <l>That old man climbed; the day grew dim;</l>
                  <l>Two swans came flying up to him</l>
                  <l>Linked by a gold chain each to each</l>
                  <l>And with low murmuring laughing speech</l>
                  <l>Alighted on the windy grass.</l>
                  <l>They knew him: his changed body was</l>
                  <l>Tall, proud and ruddy, and light wings</l>
                  <l>Were hovering over the harp strings</l>
                  <l>That Etain, Midhir’s wife, had wove</l>
                  <l>In the hid place, being crazed by love.</l>
                  <l>What shall I call them? fish that swim</l>
                  <l>Scale rubbing scale where light is dim</l>
                  <l>By a broad water-lily leaf;</l>
                  <l>Or mice in the one wheaten sheaf</l>
                  <l>Forgotten at the threshing place;</l>
                  <l/>
                  <l>Or birds lost in the one clear space</l>
                  <l>Of morning light in a dim sky;</l>
                  <l>Or it may be, the eyelids of one eye</l>
                  <l>Or the door pillars of one house,</l>
                  <l>Or two sweet blossoming apple boughs</l>
                  <l>That have one shadow on the ground;</l>
                  <l>Or the two strings that made one sound</l>
                  <l>Where that wise harper’s finger ran;</l>
                  <l>For this young girl and this young man</l>
                  <l>Have happiness without an end</l>
                  <l>Because they have made so good a friend.</l>
                  <l>They know all wonders, for they pass</l>
                  <l>The towery gates of Gorias</l>
                  <l>And Findrias and Falias</l>
                  <l>And long-forgotten Murias,</l>
                  <l>Among the giant kings whose hoard</l>
                  <l>Cauldron and spear and stone and sword</l>
                  <l>Was robbed before Earth gave the wheat;</l>
                  <l>Wandering from broken street to street</l>
                  <l>They come where some huge watcher is</l>
                  <l>And tremble with their love and kiss.</l>
                  <l/>
                  <l>They know undying things, for they</l>
                  <l>Wander where earth withers away,</l>
                  <l>Though nothing troubles the great streams</l>
                  <l>But light from the pale stars, and gleams</l>
                  <l>From the holy orchards, where there is none</l>
                  <l>But fruit that is of precious stone,</l>
                  <l>Or apples of the sun and moon.</l>
                  <l>What were our praise to them: they eat</l>
                  <l>Quiet’s wild heart, like daily meat,</l>
                  <l>Who when night thickens are afloat</l>
                  <l>On dappled skins in a glass boat</l>
                  <l>Far out under a windless sky,</l>
                  <l>While over them birds of Aengus fly,</l>
                  <l>And over the tiller and the prow</l>
                  <l>And waving white wings to and fro</l>
                  <l>Awaken wanderings of light air</l>
                  <l>To stir their coverlet and their hair.</l>
                  <l>And poets found, old writers say,</l>
                  <l>A yew tree where his body lay,</l>
                  <l>But a wild apple hid the grass</l>
                  <l/>
                  <l>With its sweet blossom where hers was;</l>
                  <l>And being in good heart, because</l>
                  <l>A better time had come again</l>
                  <l>After the deaths of many men,</l>
                  <l>And that long fighting at the ford,</l>
                  <l>They wrote on tablets of thin board,</l>
                  <l>Made of the apple and the yew,</l>
                  <l>All the love stories that they knew.</l>
                  <l>Let rush and bird cry out their fill</l>
                  <l>Of the harper’s daughter if they will,</l>
                  <l>Beloved, I am not afraid of her</l>
                  <l>She is not wiser nor lovelier,</l>

                  <l>For all her wanderings over-sea;</l>

                  <l>I have no happiness in dreaming of Brycelinde;</l>

                  <l>And Niam, and Laban, and Fand, who could change to an otter or fawn</l>
                  <l>And the wood-woman whose lover was changed to a blue-eyed hawk;</l>
                  <l>And whether I go in my dreams by woodland, or dun, or shore,</l>
                  <l>Or on the unpeopled waves with kings to pull at the oar,</l>
                  <l>I hear the harp string praise them or hear their mournful talk.</l>
                  <l>Because of a story I heard under the thin horn</l>
                  <l>Of the third moon, that hung between the night and the day,</l>
                  <l>To dream of women whose beauty was folded in dismay,</l>

                  <l>From the play of The Country of the Young.</l>
                  <l>There’s many a strong farmer</l>
                  <l>Whose heart would break in two</l>
                  <l>If he could see the townland</l>
                  <l>That we are riding to;</l>
                  <l>Boughs have their fruit and blossom,</l>
                  <l>At all times of the year,</l>
                  <l>Rivers are running over</l>
                  <l>With red beer and brown beer.</l>
                  <l>An old man plays the bagpipes</l>
                  <l>In a golden and silver wood,</l>
                  <l>Queens, their eyes blue like the ice,</l>
                  <l>Are dancing in a crowd.</l>
                  <l/>
                  <l>The little fox he murmured,</l>
                  <l>‘O what is the world’s bane?’</l>
                  <l>The sun was laughing sweetly,</l>
                  <l>The moon plucked at my rein;</l>
                  <l>But the little red fox murmured,</l>
                  <l>‘O do not pluck at his rein,</l>
                  <l>He is riding to the townland</l>
                  <l>That is the world’s bane.’</l>
                  <l>When their hearts are so high,</l>
                  <l>That they would come to blows,</l>
                  <l>They unhook their heavy swords</l>

                  <l>That would let the spade lie,</l>
                  <l>For their hearts would be like a cup</l>

                  <l>Gabriel will come from the water</l>
                  <l>With a fish tail, and talk</l>

                  <l>On wet roads where men walk,</l>
                  <l>And lift up an old horn</l>
                  <l>Of hammered silver, and drink</l>
                  <l>Till he has fallen asleep</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>I made some of these poems walking about among the Seven Woods, before the big wind of nineteen hundred and three blew down so many trees, &amp; troubled the wild creatures, &amp; changed the look of things; and I thought out there a good part of the play which follows. The first shape of it came to me in a dream, but it changed much in the making, foreshadowing, it may be, a change that may bring a less dream-burdened will into my verses. I never re-wrote anything so many times; for at first I could not make these wills that stream into mere life poetical. But now I hope to do easily much more of the kind, and that our new Irish players will find the buskin and the sock.</l>

                  <l>BARACH, a fool.</l>
                  <l>A Young Man.</l>
                  <l>Young Kings and Old Kings.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>SCENE: A great hall by the sea close to Dundalgan. There are two great chairs on either side of the hall, each raised a little from the ground, and on the back of the one chair is carved and painted a woman with a fish’s tail, and on the back of the other a hound. There are smaller chairs and benches raised in tiers round the walls. There is a great ale vat at one side near a small door, &amp; a large door at the back through which one can see the sea. Barach, a tall thin man with long ragged hair, dressed in skins, comes in at the side door. He is leading Fintain, a fat blind man, who is somewhat older.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg/>
               <lg>

               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>I will shut the door, for this wind out of the sea gets into my bones, and if I leave but an inch for the wind there is one like a flake of sea-frost that might come into the house.</l>

                  <l>It’s a woman from among the Riders of the Sidhe. It’s Boann herself from the river. She has left the Dagda’s bed, and gone through the salt of the sea &amp; up here to the strand of Baile, and all for love of me. Let her keep her husband’s bed, for she’ll have none of me. Nobody knows how lecherous these goddesses are. I see her in every kind of shape but oftener than not she’s in the wind and cries ‘give a kiss and put your arms about me.’ But no, she’ll have no more of me. Yesterday when I put out my lips to kiss her, there was nothing there but the wind. She’s bad, Fintain. O, she’s bad. I had better shut the big door too. (He is going towards the big door but turns hearing Fintain’s voice.)</l>

                  <l>Lead me to it. (He mutters while the fool is leading him.) That is what the High King Concobar has on his shield. The High King will be coming. They have brought out his chair. (He begins feeling the back of the other chair.) And there is a dog’s head on this. They have brought out our master’s chair. Now I know what the horse-boys were talking about. We must not stay here. The Kings are going to meet here. Now that Concobar and our master, that is his chief man, have put down all the enemies of Ullad, they are going to build up Emain again. They are going to talk over their plans for building it. Were you ever in Concobar’s town before it was burnt? O, he is a great King, for though Emain was burnt down, every war had made him richer. He has gold and silver dishes, and chessboards and candle-sticks made of precious stones. Fool, have they taken the top from the ale vat?</l>

                  <l>I was creeping under a ditch, with the fowl in my leather bag, keeping to the shore where the farmer could not see me, when I came upon a ship drawn up upon the sands, a great red ship with a woman’s head upon it.</l>

                  <l>There was a young man with a pale face and red hair standing beside it. Some of our people came up whose turn it was to guard the shore. I heard them ask the young man his name. He said he was under bonds not to tell it. Then words came between them, and they fought, &amp; the young man killed half of them, and the others ran away.</l>

                  <l>Well, forget it again, and I will tell you about Aoife’s country. It is full of wonders. There are a great many Queens there who can change themselves into wolves and into swine and into white hares, and when they are in their own shapes they are stronger than almost any man; and there are young men there who have cat’s eyes and if a bird chirrup or a mouse squeak they cannot keep them shut even though it is bedtime and they sleepy; and listen, for this is a great wonder, a very great wonder, there is a long narrow bridge, and when anybody goes to cross it, that the Queens do not like, it flies up as this bench would if you were to sit on the end of it. Everybody who goes there to learn skill in arms has to cross it. It was in that country too that Cuchullain got his spear made out of dragon bones. There were two dragons fighting in the foam of the sea, &amp; their grandam was the moon, and six Queens came along the shore.</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>Barach and blind Fintain.</l>

               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>They always flock together; the blind man</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Has need of the fool’s eyesight and strong body,</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>While the poor fool has need of the other’s wit,</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>And night and day is up to his ears in mischief</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>That the blind man imagines. There’s no hen-yard</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>But clucks and cackles when he passes by</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>As if he’d been a fox. If I’d that ball</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>That’s in your hair and the big stone again,</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>I’d keep them tossing, though the one is heavy</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>And the other light in the hand. A trick I learnt</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>When I was learning arms in Aoife’s country.</l>

                  <l>But I have heard that she was never married,</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>And yet that’s natural, for I have never known</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>A fighting woman, but made her favours cheap,</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Or mocked at love till she grew sandy dry.</l>

               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>A gentle or a fierce.</l>

               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>I think that a fierce woman’s better, a woman</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>That breaks away when you have thought her won,</l>

               <lg/>
               <lg>
                  <l>I think that all deep passion is but a kiss</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>In the mid battle, and a difficult peace</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>A brief forgiveness between opposites</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>That have been hatreds for three times the age</l>

                  <l>Of his long ’stablished ground. Here’s Concobar;</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>So I’ll be done, but keep beside me still,</l>

                  <l>(Concobar, a man much older than Cuchullain, has come in through the great door at the back. He has many Kings about him. One of these Kings, Daire, a stout old man, is somewhat drunk.)</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>YOUNG MAN.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>(Drawing his sword.)</l>

                  <l>(He is silent a moment then speaks to all.)</l>

               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>I too am of that ancient seed and carry</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>To have shown the hawk’s grey feather is enough</l>

                  <l>And you speak highly too.</l>

                  <l>(Cuchullain comes down from his great chair. He remains standing on the steps of the chair. The young Kings gather about him and begin to arm him.)</l>

               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>I’d thought they had grown weary sending champions.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>That coat will do. I’d half forgotten, boy,</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>How all those great kings came into the mouse-trap</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>That had been baited with Maeve’s pretty daughter.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>How Findabair, that blue-eyed Findabair—</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>But the tale is worthy of a winter’s night.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>That buckle should be tighter. Give me your shield.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>There is good level ground at Baile’s Yew-tree</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>Some dozen yards from here, and it’s but truth</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>That I am sad to-day and this fight welcome.</l>

                  <l>(He looks hard at the Young Man, and then steps down on to the floor of the Assembly House. He grasps the Young Man by the shoulder.)</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>Of her that I was speaking of but now:</l>

               <lg/>
               <lg>
                  <l>Not a pin’s difference.</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>You are from the North</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Where there are many that have that tint of hair</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Red brown, the light red brown. Come nearer, boy!</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>For I would have another look at you.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>There’s more likeness, a pale, a stone pale cheek.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>What brought you, boy? Have you no fear of death?</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>YOUNG MAN.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Whether I live or die is in the Gods’ hands.</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>I am their plough, their harrow, their very strength,</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>For he that’s in the sun begot this body</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Upon a mortal woman, and I have heard tell</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>It seemed as if he had outrun the moon,</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>That he must always follow through waste heaven,</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>He loved so happily. He’ll be but slow</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>To break a tree that was so sweetly planted.</l>

                  <l>Let’s see that arm; I’ll see it if I like.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>That arm had a good father and a good mother</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>But it is not like this.</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>YOUNG MAN.</l>

                  <l>You are mocking me.</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>You think I am not worthy to be fought,</l>

                  <l>But I’ll not wrangle but with this talkative knife.</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>I’d have you for my friend, but if it’s not</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Because you have a hot heart and a cold eye</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>I cannot tell the reason. You’ve got her fierceness,</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>In sandy places where the wool-white foam</l>

                  <l>Is murmuring and breaking, and it may be</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>To dance in the yellow fire-light. You hang your head,</l>

Lie there till the Kings come, I’ll tell them all about you. I shall tell it all. How you sit warming yourself, when you have made me light a fire of sticks, while I sit blowing it with my mouth.

               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from people in all walks of life.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.</l>

               <lg>
                  <l>The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non-profit 501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal Revenue Service. The Foundation’s EIN or federal tax identification number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by U.S. federal laws and your state’s laws.</l>

                  <l>The Foundation’s business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to date contact information can be found at the Foundation’s website and official page at www.gutenberg.org/contact</l>

                  <l>Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread public support and donations to carry out its mission of increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations ($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt status with the IRS.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state visit <ref target="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</ref>.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who approach us with offers to donate.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate</l>

               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.</l>
               </lg>
               <lg>
                  <l>Most people start at our website which has the main PG search facility: <ref target="https://www.gutenberg.org/">www.gutenberg.org</ref>.</l>

                  <l>This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™, including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.</l>
